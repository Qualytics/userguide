# Configuration

* When the Datastore connection details are submitted, a synchronous `Connection Verification` operation will be initiated to verify that the indicated Datastore can be accessed appropriately from Firewall. 

* The result of that operation will either return an error message to you on the new Datastore form view on failure, or mark the new Datastore as `Connected` and initiate an asynchronous `Catalog` operation on success.  

* If any future Operation is unable to establish a connection to the Datastore - the connected property of the Datastore will be set false. The UI will prompt the user to address any such Data Store connectivity issues.

* When an `Enrichment Store` is added, itâ€™ll be populated in the main Enrichment Data Store listings along with other data stores:
