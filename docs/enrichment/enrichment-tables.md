# Enrichment Tables

When anomalies are detected, the platform writes metadata into four primary enrichment tables:

- <enrichment_prefix\>_check_metrics
- <enrichment_prefix\>_failed_checks
- <enrichment_prefix\>_source_records
- <enrichment_prefix\>_scan_operations

## _CHECK_METRICS_Table

Captures and logs detailed metrics for every data quality check performed within the Qualytics Platform, providing insights into asserted and anomalous records across datasets.

!!! info
	This table is not characterized by unique `ANOMALY_UUID` or `QUALITY_CHECK_ID` values alone. Instead, the combination of `ANOMALY_UUID` and `QUALITY_CHECK_ID` serves as a composite key, uniquely identifying each record in the table.
