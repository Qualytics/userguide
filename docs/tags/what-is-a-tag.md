# What is a Tag?

* Tags are labels that can be applied to `Checks` and ultimately `Anomalies`.
* Tags are utilized to drive `notifications` and downstream `workflows`. Users can configure `Tags` through Settings, associate Notifications based on Tags, and associate the Tag to a Check:

* Details:
    * `Name` is the name of the tag.
    * `Color Pickup`:
        * Select any color for the specific Tag
        * Use Hexadecimal number or select by clicking on the color picker
    
* Once a tag is created, it's ready to be associated with a `Check`, `Notification` and ultimately an `Anomaly` in order to drive a Notification to a user. For more details of Tag association, please refer to [tag association](/checks/what-is-an-authored-check/#add-a-new-data-quality-check).
