# Getting Started

## What is Qualytics?

* The complete solution to instill `trust` and `confidence` in your enterprise data ecosystem.
    1. With automated `data profiling`, `data quality rule inference`, `anomaly detection` & `remediation`.

* The Active Data Quality Platform that enables teams to `manage data quality` at scale through advanced automation.
## What does Qualytics do?

* Qualytics enables your data teams to `address data issues faster` in a proactive manner by automating the `discovery` and `maintenance` of data quality measures you need.
    1. Your `historic data` is analyzed for its shapes and patterns in order to infer contextual data quality rules. 
    2. These rules are asserted to find anomalies in new data (often in incremental loads).
    3. When an anomaly is found, along with traditional alerting, `a target datastore` is `enriched` with the anomaly along with the metadata that triggered it, enabling your team to `take corrective actions` using their existing data tooling.

* We combine `data quality rules` with additional context such as `alerts`, `tags` & `tolerances` as a set of data quality checks.


## Using Qualytics involves a few operations post initial Datastore configuration:

* `Catalog`
    1. `Preps metadata` to be consumed by Qualytics.

* `Profile`
    1. `Generates metadata` by touching historic data.
    2. `Generates and Updates` data quality checks.

* `Scan`
    1. Asserts data quality checks on full or incremental loads of data to generate anomalies.

* `Enrich`
    1. While this is automatic behind scenes, enrichment enables us to write anomalies to a destination of user’s choosing.

* As a quick reference, here is a short video demonstrating the platform with a quick walkthrough:

## Focus areas

* __Anomaly Detection__:
Data Quality rules are notoriously hard to author and manage at scale. Qualytics infers data quality rules automatically and gives you the ability to catch anomalies at-rest and in-flight in your data ecosystem.

* __Anomaly Remediation__:
The anomaly is the most important signal - an assertion of a rule has caught an anomaly. Often, these anomalies are addressable with corrective actions. Qualytics enables you to take corrective actions using your existing data tooling.

* __Automated Profiling__:
Historic data’s shapes and patterns are crucial to infer data quality rules at scale. Qualytics utilizes historic data to automatically build and expose profile information. This profile metadata is then used to automatically build data quality rules.

* __Flexible Deployment__:
On-premise, single-tenant cloud, or SaaS. We meet you where your data is.

* __Support Modern & Legacy Data Stacks__:
Snowflake from Oracle, S3 to MSSQL. Data Quality is important everywhere. Qualytics fits seamlessly into your data stack, with effortless integrations with any Spark-compatible datastore.
