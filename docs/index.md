# Introduction to Qualytics

Qualytics is your Active Data Quality Platform that empowers teams to manage data quality at scale through advanced automation. By analyzing the shapes and patterns in your historical data, Qualytics infers contextual data quality rules that actively monitor new data, including incremental loads, to identify anomalies. When issues arise, Qualytics provides your team with everything needed to take corrective actions using your existing data tools and preferred monitoring solutions.

## Managing Data Quality

Qualytics helps your data teams proactively address data issues by automating the discovery and maintenance of essential data quality measures.

Here's how it works:

1. **Analyzing Historical Data**: Qualytics examines your existing data to understand its patterns and characteristics, creating a comprehensive set of rules that define good data quality.

2. **Finding Anomalies**: These automatically inferred rules, along with any custom rules you create, work together to identify abnormalities in both historical and new data, even as it arrives incrementally.

3. **Taking Corrective Actions**: When Qualytics detects an anomaly, it springs into action. Using tags, it can:
    - Send notifications through your preferred platforms (Teams, Slack, PagerDuty)
    - Trigger workflows in your tools (Airflow, Fivetran, Airbyte)
    - Provide detailed anomaly information to your chosen datastore
    - Suggest optimal solutions through its intuitive interface and API

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**: Qualytics maintains constant vigilance over your data quality, automatically adapting quality checks to reflect changes in your data and business needs. This ongoing process strengthens data quality and builds confidence in your organization's data assets.

## Key Features

Qualytics delivers powerful capabilities designed to transform your data quality management:

1. **Automated Data Profiling**: Qualytics creates comprehensive profiles of your data assets automatically, providing deep insights that form the foundation of robust data quality management.

2. **Rule Inference**: Say goodbye to the challenge of manually crafting and maintaining data quality rules at scale. Qualytics automatically infers appropriate rules based on your data profiles, saving time while ensuring precise anomaly detection.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect data irregularities both at rest and in flight throughout your data ecosystem. Qualytics excels at highlighting outliers and anomalies, helping you maintain high data quality standards.

4. **Anomaly Remediation**: When issues emerge, Qualytics seamlessly integrates with your preferred tools to enable swift corrective actions through automated workflows.

5. **Freshness Monitoring**: Keep your data current with built-in monitoring of data freshness Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Define and track timeliness requirements to ensure your data meets critical business needs.

6. **Insights Dashboard**: Access a clear, intuitive executive dashboard that provides a holistic view of your data health and quality. Visualize key metrics, track progress, and derive actionable insights to drive data-driven strategies.
