# Welcome to Qualytics!

Qualytics is the complete solution to install trust and confidence in your enterprise data ecosystem. With automated data profiling, data quality rule inference, anomaly detection & remediation, Qualytics enables your data teams to address data issues faster. Qualytics automates workflows that are currently manual or simply not performed.

## Focus areas

* __Anomaly Detection__:
Data Quality rules are notoriously hard to author and manage at scale. Qualytics infers data quality rules automatically and gives you the ability to catch anomalies at-rest and in-flight in your data ecosystem.

* __Anomaly Remediation__:
The anomaly is the most important signal - an assertion of a rule has caught an anomaly. Often, these anomalies are addressable with corrective actions. Qualytics enables you to take corrective actions using your existing data tooling.

* __Automated Profiling__:
Historic dataâ€™s shapes and patterns are crucial to infer data quality rules at scale. Qualytics utilizes historic data to automatically build and expose profile information. This profile metadata is then used to automatically build data quality rules.

* __Flexible Deployment__:
On-premise, single-tenant cloud, or SaaS. We meet you where your data is.

* __Support Modern & Legacy Data Stacks__:
Snowflake from Oracle, S3 to MSSQL. Data Quality is important everywhere. Qualytics fits seamlessly into your data stack, with effortless integrations with any Spark-compatible data store.
