# Dashboard

Upon signing in to Qualytics, users are greeted with a thoughtfully designed dashboard that offers intuitive navigation and quick access to essential features and datasets, ensuring an efficient and comprehensive data quality management experience.

In this documentation, we will explore every component of the Qualytics dashboard. 

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Global Search 

The Global Search feature in Qualytics is designed to streamline the process of finding crucial assets such as Datastores, Containers, and Fields. This enhancement provides quick and precise search results, significantly improving navigation and user interaction. By entering keywords in the search bar located at the top of the dashboard, users can efficiently locate specific data elements, facilitating better data management and access. This functionality is especially useful for large datasets, ensuring users can swiftly find the information they need without navigating through multiple layers of the interface.

## In-App Notifications

In-app notifications in Qualytics are real-time alerts that keep users informed about various events related to their data operations and quality checks. These notifications are displayed within the Qualytics interface and cover a range of activities, including operation completions, anomaly detections, and service level agreement (SLA) status updates.
