## Understanding Flow States

On the bottom-right corner, there is a **Legend** indicating the possible states of an action, such as:

- **Success** (Green)
- **Failure** (Red)
- **Aborted** (Orange)
- **Skipped** (Yellow)
- **Running** (Blue with dotted lines animation)
- **Pending** (Gray)

If a step is running, you will see a **dot-line animation**, signaling that the step is in progress. Once the action completes, the **Action** box will change its color to reflect the final state.
