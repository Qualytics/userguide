# Understanding Flow States

On the bottom-right corner, there is a **Legend** indicating the possible states of an action, such as:

* **Success** (Green)

* **Failure** (Red)

* **Aborted** (Orange)

* **Skipped** (Yellow)

* **Running** (Blue with dotted lines animation)

* **Pending** (Gray)

If a step is running, you will see a **dot-line animation**, signaling that the step is in progress.  
Once completed, the Action box will change its color to reflect the final state.
