# Flows: Overview

Flows in Qualytics allow users to create pipelines by chaining actions and configuring how they are trigerred. Triggers can be set based on predefined events and filters, offering a flexible and efficient way to automate processes. These actions can be notifications or operations, allowing users to inform various notification channels or execute tasks based on specific operations.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Navigation

Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the "**Flows**" button on the left side panel of the interface.

![flows-icon](../assets/flows/overview/flows-icon-dark.png#only-dark)

## Flow Page

Here, you can view a list of all the flow you've added to the system. From this interface, you can easily manage (add, deactivate, or delete) your flow as needed.

### Search a Flow

Also you can search the flow name using the **Search Box**

![flows-page-searchbox](../assets/flows/overview/flows-page-searchbox-light.png#only-light)
![flows-page-searchbox](../assets/flows/overview/flows-page-searchbox-dark.png#only-dark)

!!! tip
    The Search box only searches by flow name. The other flow data, like ID or description will not bring the expected results.

### Sort by Flow List

And sort the list by **Name** (ascending or descending) or **Creation Date** (ascending or descending)

## Add new Flow

**Setop 1:** Click on the "**Add Flow**" button located in the top right corner of the application. 

![flows-add-new-item-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-add-new-item-1-light.png#only-light)
![flows-add-new-item-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-add-new-item-2-dark.png#only-dark)

After being redirected them to the Add Flows page you can see 2 nodes "**Flow**" and "**Trigger**".

### Setup the Flow Node

**Step 1:** Click on the "**Flow**" node. This will opens a panel on the right side of the application. 

![flows-setup-flow-node-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-1-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-node-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-1-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Fill out the Flow node form. After finishing the required fields, click on "**Save**" button.

![flows-setup-flow-node-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-2-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-node-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-2-dark.png#only-dark)

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Name*** | Add a flow name |
| **Description** | Add a flow description. This field is optional. |
| **Deactivated** | If checked this will deactivate this flow. The flow item will not until user uncheck this field  |

!!! warning
    * Required field

**Step 3:** After finishing the required fields, click on "**Save**" button.

![flows-setup-flow-node-save](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-3-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-node-save](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-3-dark.png#only-dark)

### Setup the Trigger Node

**Step 1:** Click on the "**Trigger**" node. This will opens a panel on the right side of the application. 

![flows-setup-flow-trigger-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-1-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-trigger-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-1-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Select one of the three trigger event to activate this flow.

![flows-setup-flow-trigger-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-2-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-trigger-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-2-dark.png#only-dark)

| Trigger Event | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Operations Completes** | The flow is triggered when an operation is completed. |
| **Anomalous Table or File Detected** | The flow is triggered when an anomalous table or file is detected. |
| **Anonmaly Detect** | The flow is triggered when an anomaly is detected. |
| **Manual** | The flow is triggered when user press the "**Execute**" button. |

**Step 3-1:** **Using Operations Completes**. User can filter the Completed Operations just setting the filters below.

![flows-setup-flow-trigger-3](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-3-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-trigger-3](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-3-dark.png#only-dark)

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Source Datastore Tags** | Only Source Datastores that have all selected tags assigned will trigger the flow. |
| **Operation Types** | Only Operations that match one or more of the selected types will trigger the flow. |
| **Operation Status** | Only Operations matching the selected state will trigger the flow. |

!!! warning
    The user can optionally set filters to narrow which table or files should trigger a flow execution.

**Step 3-2:** **Using Anomalous Table or File Detected**. User can filter when a Anomalous Table or File is detected.
