# Flows Overview

Flows in Qualytics allow users to create pipelines by chaining actions and configuring how they are trigerred. Triggers can be set based on predefined events and filters, offering a flexible and efficient way to automate processes. These actions can be notifications or operations, allowing users to inform various notification channels or execute tasks based on specific operations.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Navigation

Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the "**Flows**" button on the left side panel of the interface.

## Definitions

This section provides an overview of all the flows youâ€™ve added to the system. For each flow, you can view key details, including its title, description, trigger type (such as Operation Completes, Anomalous Table or File Detected, Anomaly Detected, or Manual), associated actions, and the last time it was triggered.

From here, you can easily manage your flowsâ€”add new ones, deactivate those youâ€™re not using, or delete them when theyâ€™re no longer needed.

### Search a Flow

You can quickly find a flow by typing its name in the **Search Box**.

![flows-page-searchbox](../assets/flows/overview/flows-page-searchbox-dark.png#only-dark)

!!! tip
    The search box only looks for flow names. Searching by other details, like ID or description, wonâ€™t return any results.

### Sort the Flow List

Easily sort the list of flows by **Name** or **Creation Date** in either `ascending` or `descending` order.

## Add new Flow

**Step 1:** Click on the "**Add Flow**" button located in the top right corner of the application. 

![flows-add-new-item-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-add-new-item-1-light.png#only-light)
![flows-add-new-item-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-add-new-item-2-dark.png#only-dark)

After being redirected them to the Add Flows page you can see 2 nodes "**Flow**" and "**Trigger**".

### Setup the Flow Node

**Step 1:** Click on the "**Flow**" node. This will opens a panel on the right side of the application. 

![flows-setup-flow-node-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-1-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-node-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-1-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Fill out the Flow node form. After finishing the required fields, click on "**Save**" button.

![flows-setup-flow-node-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-2-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-node-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-2-dark.png#only-dark)

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Name*** | Add a flow name |
| **Description** | Add a flow description. This field is optional. |
| **Deactivated** | If checked this will deactivate this flow. The flow item will not until user uncheck this field  |

!!! warning
    * Required field

**Step 3:** After finishing the required fields, click on "**Save**" button.

![flows-setup-flow-node-save](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-node-3-dark.png#only-dark)

### Setup the Trigger Node

**Step 1:** Click on the "**Trigger**" node. This will opens a panel on the right side of the application. 

![flows-setup-flow-trigger-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-1-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-trigger-1](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-1-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Select one of the three trigger event to activate this flow.

![flows-setup-flow-trigger-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-2-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-trigger-2](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-2-dark.png#only-dark)

| Trigger Event | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Operations Completes** | The flow is triggered when an operation is completed. |
| **Anomalous Table or File Detected** | The flow is triggered when an anomalous table or file is detected. |
| **Anonmaly Detect** | The flow is triggered when an anomaly is detected. |
| **Manual** | The flow is triggered when user press the "**Execute**" button. |

**Step 3-1:** **Using Operations Completes**. User can filter the Completed Operations just setting the filters below.

![flows-setup-flow-trigger-3](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-3-light.png#only-light)
![flows-setup-flow-trigger-3](../assets/flows/overview/flows-setup-flow-trigger-3-dark.png#only-dark)

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------|
| **Source Datastore Tags** | Only Source Datastores that have all selected tags assigned will trigger the flow. |
| **Operation Types** | Only Operations that match one or more of the selected types will trigger the flow. |

!!! warning
    The user can optionally set filters to narrow which table or files should trigger a flow execution.

**Step 3-2:** **Using Anomalous Table or File Detected**. User can filter when a Anomalous Table or File is detected.
