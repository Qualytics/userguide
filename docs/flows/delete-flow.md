# Delete Flow

**Delete Flow** feature allows you to permanently remove unwanted or outdated flows from the system. This helps in maintaining a clean and organized list of active flows.

**Step 1**: Click the **vertical ellipsis (⋮)** next to the flow that you want to delete, then click on **Delete** from the dropdown menu.
