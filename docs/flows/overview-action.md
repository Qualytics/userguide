# Action Node

Actions define the specific steps the system will execute after a flow is triggered. They allow users to automate tasks, send notifications, or interact with external systems.

**Step 1:** After completing the **"Trigger"** node setup, users can click on the **"Actions"** node.

A panel will appear on the right-hand side displaying the list of available actions. These actions define what the system will execute after the flow is triggered. The actions are categorized into three groups:

* Operations.

* Notifications.

* HTTP.

    Inline summaries are shown within action nodes, displaying key details based on the action typeâ€”for example, datastore names for operations, Slack or Teams channels for notifications, and webhook URLs for HTTP actions. This enhancement provides quick clarity during flow configuration.
