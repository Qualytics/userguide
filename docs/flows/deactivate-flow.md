# Deactivate Flow

Users can deactivate a flow to pause its triggers by disabling it. This prevents the flow from being executed until it is reactivated.

**Step 1**: Click the **vertical ellipsis (⋮)** next to the flow that you want to deactivate, then click on **Deactivate** from the dropdown menu.

!!! note
    If you accidentally deactivate a flow, you can easily reactivate it by following the steps in the [Activate Flow guide](../flows/activate-flow.md).

After clicking the **Deactivate** button, a success notification appears confirming the deactivation.

!!! warning
    Deactivating a flow only pauses its triggers — not deletes it. You can reactivate it anytime, or see the [Delete Flow](../flows/delete-flow.md) guide to remove it permanently.
