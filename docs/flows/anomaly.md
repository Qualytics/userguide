# Anomaly

Flows let you automate how anomalies are cleaned up over time. Under **Anomaly actions**, you can choose between two cleanup options:

- **Archive** → Move inactive anomalies out of the active queue  
- **Delete** → Permanently remove inactive anomalies  

Use these actions to keep your anomaly list lean, relevant, and manageable—without manually closing out each record.

## Archive

Use the **Archive** action to automatically move anomalies into an archived state when they’ve been inactive for a set amount of time. This is ideal for organizations that prefer to keep a historical record but don’t need old anomalies cluttering the active view.

### How It Works

The Archive action identifies anomalies with **no updates or comments** during the chosen **Inactivity Period** and archives them using the reason you specify.

> 💡 **Why archive instead of delete?**  
> Archiving lets you clean up the active queue without losing historical context.

#### Inactivity Period

Choose how long an anomaly must remain untouched before being archived.

Options include:

- Week
- Month
- Quarter
- Year

!!! note
    Anomalies are archived automatically if they have no updates or comments during the selected inactivity period.

#### Archive Reason

Define why these anomalies are being archived:

- **Resolved** — The anomaly represents a valid data quality issue that has been fixed.  
- **Invalid** — The anomaly wasn’t a legitimate issue.  
- **Discarded** — The anomaly is no longer relevant or under review. *(Most common for automation.)*

#### Assign Additional Tags 

Automatically apply tags to anomalies archived through this flow. Useful for labeling cleanup runs (e.g., `auto-archive-q4`).

#### Comment (Optional)

Provide a note that will appear on every archived anomaly, giving future reviewers context.

#### Filter Conditions 

You can narrow down **which anomalies** should be archived:

- **Source Datastores** — Archive anomalies from selected datastores only  

![conditions](../assets/flows/anomalies.png)

- **Anomaly Tags** — Archive anomalies labeled with specific tags

##  Delete

The **Delete** action permanently removes anomalies after a set inactivity period. Use this when you don't need to retain historical anomaly records—e.g., for ephemeral data or noise cleanup.

![delete](../assets/flows/delete.png)

!!! warning
    Delete permanently removes anomalies from the system. This cannot be undone.

### How It Works

The Delete action looks for anomalies that have had **no updates or comments** during the selected **Inactivity Period** and permanently removes them. This helps you clear out old or unnecessary anomalies that you no longer need.

> ⚠️ **Why delete instead of archive?**  
> Delete removes the anomaly completely, which is useful when you don’t need to keep any record of it.

#### Inactivity Period

Define how long an anomaly must remain inactive before deletion.

Options include:

- Week
- Month
- Quarter
- Year

![inactivity-period](../assets/flows/inactivity-delete.png)

!!! note 
    Anomalies are deleted if they have no updates or comments during the selected inactivity period.

#### Source Datastores 

Delete anomalies originating from specific datastores.

![delete-specific](../assets/flows/delete-specific.png)

#### Anomaly Statuses  

Target anomaly states such as:

- Active
- Acknowledged
- Resolved  
- Duplicate
- Invalid  
- Discarded  

![anomaly-status](../assets/flows/anomaly-status.png)

#### Anomaly Tags  

Delete anomalies that carry specific tags (e.g., `test-data`, `noise`).

## 📘 When to Use Archive vs Delete

| Action | Best for | Keeps history? | Suitable for |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Archive** | Cleaning up long-ignored anomalies while retaining context | ✅ Yes | Audit needs, compliance workflows, long-term reference |
| **Delete** | Removing noise or temporary anomalies completely | ❌ No | Test data cleanup, non-critical anomalies, high-volume events |
