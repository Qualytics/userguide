# Grouping Overview

The grouping is a fundamental aspect of data analysis, allowing users to organize data into meaningful categories for in-depth examination. With the ability to set grouping on Containers, users can define how data within a container should be grouped, facilitating more focused and efficient analysis.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Managing an Grouping

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the source datastore (**JDBC** or **DFS**) from the left menu that you want to manage.

![grouping](../assets/identifiers/grouping-overview/datastore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Select Tables (if JDBC datastore is connected) or File Patterns (if DFS datastore is connected) from the Navigation tab on the top.

![table](../assets/identifiers/grouping-overview/table-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3:** You will view the full list of tables or files belonging to the selected source datastore.

**Step 4:** Click on the vertical ellipse next to the table of your choice and select **Settings** from the dropdown list.

A modal window will appear for **‚ÄúTable Settings‚Äù**, where you can manage grouping for the selected table.Use the **Grouping** section to organize fields, with a warning to avoid large row groupings to maintain performance. Add grouping logic via **Group Criteria**.

## Usage

The `grouping` parameter accepts a list of lists of field names. Each inner list holds the field names in the order that they will be applied as grouping criteria. This flexibility allows users to customize the grouping behavior based on their specific analytical requirements.

### Example

Consider the following examples of `grouping` configurations:

1. `["store_id"]`: Groups data within the container by the `store_id` field.
2. `["store_id", "month"]`: Groups data first by `store_id`, then by `month`.
3. `["store_id", "state"]`: Groups data first by `store_id`, then by `state`.

By specifying different combinations of fields in the `grouping` parameter, users can tailor the grouping behavior to suit their analytical needs.

## Impact on Data Profiles

The grouping has implications for various aspects of data profiling and analysis within Qualytics.

### Field Profiles

Field Profiles are now produced with filters determined by the `grouping` specified on the Profile Operation. This means that the profiles generated will reflect the characteristics of data within each group defined by the grouping criteria.

### Inferred Quality Checks

The inferred checks produced by the analytics engine will also hold the filter defined by the `grouping`. This ensures that data access controls and constraints are applied consistently across different groupings of data within the container.

### Inferred Quality Check Filters

Quality Check filters, represented as Spark SQL where clauses, are set based on the `grouping` specified on the Profile Operation. This ensures that quality checks are applied appropriately to the data within each group, allowing for comprehensive data validation and quality assurance.

## Conclusion

The introduction of Grouping for Containers in Qualytics enhances data organization and analysis capabilities, allowing users to define custom grouping criteria and analyze data at a granular level. By leveraging `grouping`, users can gain deeper insights into their data and streamline the analytical process, ultimately driving more informed decision-making and improving overall data quality and reliability.
