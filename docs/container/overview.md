# Containers Overview

Containers are fundamental entities representing structured data sets. These containers could manifest as tables in JDBC datastores or as files within DFS datastores. They play a pivotal role in data organization, profiling, and quality checks within the Qualytics application.

Let’s get started 🚀

## Container Types

There are two main types of containers in Qualytics:

### JDBC Container

!!! note
    For more information please refer to the [container type documentation](../container/container-types.md#jdbc-container).
    
### DFS Container

!!! note 
    For more information please refer to the [dfs container section](../container/container-types.md#dfs-container).

## Container Attributes

### Totals

!!! note
    Totals are calculated from sampled data, not the full dataset. Values may differ from actual totals across all records.
    For more information please refer to the [container attributes documentation](../container/container-attributes.md).

## Actions on Container

Users can perform various operations on containers to manage datasets effectively. The actions are divided into three main sections: **Settings**, **Add**, and **Run**. Each section contains specific options to perform different tasks.

    For more information please refer to the [actions on container documentation](../container/actions-on-container.md).

## Field Profiles

After profiling a container, individual field profiles offer granular insights:
