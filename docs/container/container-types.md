# Container Types

There are two main types of containers in Qualytics:

## JDBC Container

JDBC containers are virtual representations of database objects, making it easier to work with data stored in relational databases. These containers include tables, which organize data into rows and columns like a spreadsheet, views that provide customized displays of data from one or more tables, and other database objects such as indexes or stored procedures. Acting as a bridge between applications and databases, JDBC enables seamless interaction with these containers, allowing efficient data management and retrieval.

## DFS Container

DFS containers are used to represent files stored in distributed file systems, such as Hadoop or cloud storage. These files can include formats like CSV, JSON, or Parquet, which are commonly used for storing and organizing data. DFS containers make it easier for applications to work with these files by providing a structured way to access and process data in large-scale storage systems.
