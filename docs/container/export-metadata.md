## Export Quality Checks and Field Profiles to an Enrichment Datastore

Qualytics enables the exportation of Quality Checks and Field Profiles metadata from selected containers. Upon initiating the export, this metadata is stored in the designated enrichment datastore. The stored metadata will be named using the pattern `_<datastore_name>_checks` for Quality Checks and `_<datastore_name>_field_profiles `for Field Profiles.

## **Prerequisites**

Before exporting quality checks and field profiles, ensure that you have the following:

* **An enrichment datastore already setup that can accommodate the exported data**
