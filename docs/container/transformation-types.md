# Types of Transformations

## Cleaned Entity Name

This transformation removes common business signifiers from entity names, making your data cleaner and more uniform.

### Options for Cleaned Entity Name

| REF. | FIELDS | ACTIONS |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1.   | **Drop from Suffix** | Add a unique name for your computed field. |
| 2.   | **Drop from Prefix** | Removes specified terms from the beginning of the entity name. |
| 3.   | **Drop from Interior** | Removes specified terms from the beginning of the entity name. |
| 4.   | **Additional Terms to Drop** (Custom) | Allows you to specify additional terms that should be dropped from the entity name. |
| 5.   | **Terms to Ignore** (Custom) | Designate terms that should be ignored during the cleaning process. |

### Example for Cleaned Entity Name

| **Example** | **Input**                  | **Transformation**             | **Output**               |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1           | "TechCorp, Inc."           | **Drop from Suffix**: "Inc."   | "TechCorp"               |
| 2           | "Global Services Ltd."     | **Drop from Prefix**: "Global" | "Services Ltd."          |
| 3           | "Central LTD & Finance Co."      | **Drop from Interior**: "LTD"    | "Central & Finance Co."     |
| 4           | "Eat & Drink LLC"          | **Additional Terms to Drop**: "LLC", "&" | "Eat Drink" |
| 5           | "ProNet Solutions Ltd."    | **Terms to Ignore**: "Ltd."    | "ProNet Solutions"       |

## Convert Formatted Numeric

This transformation converts formatted numeric values into a plain numeric format, stripping out any characters like commas or parentheses that are not numerically significant.

### Example for Convert Formatted Numeric

| **Example** | **Input**   | **Transformation** | **Output** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1           | "$1,234.56" | **Remove non-numeric characters**: ",", "$" | "1234.56"  |
| 2           | "(2020)"    | **Remove non-numeric characters**: "(", ")" | "-2020"    |
| 3           | "100%"      | **Remove non-numeric characters**: "%"      | "100"      

## Custom Expression

Enables the creation of a field based on a custom computation using Spark SQL. This is useful for applying complex logic or transformations that are not covered by other types.

### Using Custom Expression:
   You can combine multiple fields, apply conditional logic, or use any valid Spark SQL functions to derive your new computed field.
   
   **Example**: To create a field that sums two existing fields, you could use the expression `SUM(field1, field2)`.

   **Advanced Example**: You need to ensure that a log of leases has no overlapping dates for an asset but your data only captures a single lease's details like 
   
| **LeaseID** |  **AssetID** | **Lease_Start** | **Lease_End** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1           | 42          | 1/1/2025         |   2/1/2026    |
| 2           | 43          | 1/1/2025         |   2/1/2026    |
| 3           | 42          | 1/1/2026         |   2/1/2026    |
| 4           | 43          | 2/2/2026         |   2/1/2027    |

You can see in this example that Lease 1 has overlapping dates with Lease 3 for the same Asset. This can be difficult to detect without a full transformation of the data. However, we can accomplish our goal easily with a Computed Field.
We'll simply add a Computed Field to our table named "Next_Lease_Start" and define it with the following custom expression so that our table will now hold the new field and render it as shown below.

`LEAD(Lease_Start, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY AssetID ORDER BY Lease_Start)` 

 | **LeaseID** |  **AssetID** | **Lease_Start** | **Lease_End** | **Next_Lease_Start** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|------------|
| 1           | 42          | 1/1/2025         |   2/1/2026    | 1/1/2026    |
| 2           | 43          | 1/1/2025         |   2/1/2026    | 2/2/2026    |
| 3           | 42          | 1/1/2026         |   2/1/2026    |             |
| 4           | 43          | 2/2/2026         |   2/1/2027    |             |

Now you can author a Quality Check stating that Lease_End should always be less than "Next_Lease_Start" to catch any errors of this type. In fact, Qualytics will automatically infer that check for you at [Level 3 Inference](../source-datastore/profile.md#levels-of-check-inference)!

### More Examples for Custom Expression

| **Example** | **Input Fields**  | **Custom Expression**  | **Output**   |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1   | `field1 = 10`, `field2 = 20` | `SUM(field1, field2)` | `30`  |
| 2   | `salary = 50000`, `bonus = 5000` | `salary + bonus`  | `55000` |
| 3   | `hours = 8`, `rate = 15.50` | `hours * rate`         | `124`   |
| 4   | `status = 'active'`, `score = 85` | `CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN score ELSE 0 END` | `85` |
