# Connections

The Connections Management section allows you to manage global configurations for various connections to different data sources. This provides you with a centralized interface for managing all the data connections, ensuring efficient data integration and enrichment processes. You can easily navigate and manage your connections by utilizing the search, sort, edit, and delete features.

Let's get started ðŸš€

## Navigation to Connection

**Step 1**: Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **Settings** button on the left sidebar of the interface.

## Manage Connection

You can effectively manage your connections by editing, deleting, and adding datastores to maintain accuracy and efficiency.

!!! warning
    Before deleting a connection, ensure that all associated datastores and enrichment datastores have been removed.

### Edit Connection

You can edit connections to update details such as name, account, role, warehouse, and authentication to improve performance. This keeps connection settings up-to-date and suited to your data needs.

!!! note
    You can only edit the connection name and connection details, but you are not able to edit the connector itself.

**Step 1**: Click the **vertical ellipsis (â‹®)** next to the connection that you want to edit, then click on **Edit** from the dropdown menu.

### Add Datastore

You can add new or existing datastores and enrichment datastores directly from the connection, making it easy to manage and access your data while ensuring all sources are connected and available.

Once you have successfully added a datastore to the connection, a success message will appear.
