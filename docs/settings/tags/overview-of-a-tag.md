# Tags

Tags allow users to categorize and organize data assets effectively and provide the ability to assign weights for prioritization. They drive notifications and downstream workflows, enabling users to stay informed and take appropriate actions. Tags can be configured and associated with specific properties, allowing for targeted actions and efficient management of entities across multiple datastores. 

Tags can be applied to Datastores, Profiles, Fields, Checks, and Anomalies, streamlining data management and improving workflow efficiency. Overall, tags enhance organization, prioritization, and decision-making.
