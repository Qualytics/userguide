# Jira

The **Jira** integration is available in the **Qualytics** platform for tracking and managing data quality issues as Jira tickets. It allows teams to create Jira issues when data quality checks fail in **Qualytics**, helping teams investigate, assign,and resolve issues using existing Jira workflows.
