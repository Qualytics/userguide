# Ticketing Integrations

The **Qualytics** platform integrates with enterprise ticketing systems to help teams track and resolve data quality issues using their existing issue and incident management workflows.

These integrations enable teams to:

- Track and manage data quality issues within familiar ticketing tools  
- Create tickets from data quality failures for investigation and resolution  
- Assign ownership and monitor progress using standard workflows  
- Align data quality remediation with existing operational processes  
- Maintain visibility into data quality issues alongside other work items  

This approach helps make data quality management a natural extension of your team’s established workflows rather than a separate process to manage.

## Available Integrations

**Qualytics** currently supports the following ticketing integrations:

### Jira

Integrate **Qualytics** with **Jira** to create and manage issues related to data quality failures. This allows teams to triage, assign, and track resolution progress using their existing Jira workflows.
