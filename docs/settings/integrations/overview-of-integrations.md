## Overview

Designed to enhance data governance and quality management through synchronization with various data catalog platforms. These integrations allow users to manage and synchronize assets across multiple systems, streamlining data operations and ensuring consistency and quality across the data ecosystem.

## Atlan Integration Guide

### Creating an Atlan persona and Policy

Before initiating the integration process, itâ€™s advisable to set up an Atlan persona. This persona enables you to grant the necessary access for Qualytics's API token to the metadata and data of the connections you plan to integrate. Although the persona can be created simultaneously with the API token, establishing it beforehand simplifies the process, allowing you to directly associate it with the token later.

Keep in mind that enabling Atlan for a data source requires that you first authorize the API token with access to the requisite metadata and data. This is done through policies set within the persona for the Atlan connection that matches the Qualytics data source, and it must be done for each data source you intend to integrate.

1. Go to `Governance` and `Personas`

### Creating an Atlan Personal Access Token

After creating the persona, you need to create a personal access token

1. Go to `API tokens` in Admin center

!!!note
    The assets you wish to sync must have the appropriate permissions in Atlan


### Qualytics syncing to Custom Metadata in Atlan

Synchronize metadata across systems, including asset URLs, total scores, and detailed quality factor scores such as completeness, coverage, conformity, consistency, precision, timeliness, volume, and accuracy.

#### Atlan Alerts and Announcements

After synchronization, Qualytics will issue alerts for tables where anomalies were detected during a scan
