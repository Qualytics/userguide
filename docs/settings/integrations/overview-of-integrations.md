## Overview
This guide outlines the integration capabilities within the settings of the Qualytics Data Quality platform, designed to enhance data governance and quality management through synchronization with various data catalog platforms. These integrations allow users to manage and synchronize assets across multiple systems, streamlining data operations and ensuring consistency and quality across the data ecosystem.

## Integration Features

### Tag Sync

Sync tags from data catalogs to Qualytics to enable tag-based quality score reporting, notifications, and bulk data quality operations.

### Metadata Sync 

Synchronize metadata across systems, including asset URLs, total scores, and detailed quality factor scores such as completeness, coverage, conformity, consistency, precision, timeliness, volume, and accuracy.

### Alerts

Generate alerts to inform users about anomalies detected in data assets, enhancing proactive data quality management.

## Atlan Integration

### Creating an Atlan persona

Before initiating the integration process, itâ€™s advisable to set up an Atlan persona. This persona enables you to grant the necessary access for Qualytics's API token to the metadata and data of the connections you plan to integrate. Although the persona can be created simultaneously with the API token, establishing it beforehand simplifies the process, allowing you to directly associate it with the token later.

Keep in mind that enabling Atlan for a data source requires that you first authorize the API token with access to the requisite metadata and data. This is done through policies set within the persona for the Atlan connection that matches the Qualytics data source, and it must be done for each data source you intend to integrate.

4. Click in `Sync` button and wait until Qualytics have created the external tags and set them to the respective qualytics assets.

5. You can look at the logs to investigate syncing issues

Note that the assets you want to sync need to have the right permissions in Atlan.

### Tag Syncing

Sync tags assigned to data assets in Atlan with the corresponding assets in Qualytics.


### Metadata Syncing

Automatically synchronize metadata between Atlan and Qualytics.
