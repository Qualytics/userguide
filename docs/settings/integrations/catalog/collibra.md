# Collibra

The **Collibra** integration allows **Qualytics** to sync data quality metadata with Collibra, making quality context available directly within governance workflows. Data quality checks, anomalies, and related metadata are aligned with governed assets to support informed decision-making. Synchronization is handled at the metadata level and does not require a specific target configuration.
