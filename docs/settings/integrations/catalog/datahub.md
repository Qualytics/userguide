# DataHub

The **DataHub** integration enables **Qualytics** to sync data quality metadata into DataHub, providing visibility into checks, anomalies, and quality context alongside cataloged assets. This helps teams discover and assess data with quality signals included. Synchronization operates at the metadata level and does not require a specific target configuration.
