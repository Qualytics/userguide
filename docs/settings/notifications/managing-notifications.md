# Managing Notifications

In Qualytics, managing notifications gives you full control over how and when you receive alerts. You can customize notifications to fit your needs, mute or unmute them to manage distractions and delete notifications to keep your system organized. By effectively managing your notifications, you ensure that critical updates reach you at the right time, while unnecessary alerts are minimized, allowing you to stay focused on what matters most.

Let's get started 🚀

## Navigation

Qualytics gives you full control over your notifications, allowing you to edit notification rules, mute notifications, and delete unwanted notification rules. You can navigate to the notifications management settings via two different methods as discussed below.  

### Method I: User Interface

**Step1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the bell **"🔔"** icon located in the top right navigation bar.

![bell-icon](../../../assets/notifications/manage-notifications/bell-icon-light-1.png#only-light)
![bell-icon](../../../assets/notifications/manage-notifications/bell-icon-dark-1.png#only-dark)

Here, you can view all the notifications that have been triggered based on your notification rules. You can also edit or mute the notification rule directly from this interface.

You can switch between the different types of notifications to have a categorical view(such as **All**, **Operations**, **Anomalies**, or **SLA)**.

## Edit Notifications Rule

You can edit the notification rules by adjusting trigger conditions, customizing the notification message, adding datastore tags, and adding or removing notification channels. These management options make sure your notifications fit your needs and preferences. There are two methods from which you can edit your notification rules.

### Method I: From User Interface

You can directly navigate to the notification generated and appearing on the user interface and edit the rule that triggered such notification. 

!!! note 
    If you edit the notification rule directly from the User Interface, the changes will apply to the entire rule, ensuring that all future notifications triggered from such an updated rule follow the latest modification.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the bell; **"🔔"** icon located in the top right navigation bar.

![bell-icon](../../../assets/notifications/manage-notifications/bell-icon-light-7.png#only-light)

## Mute Notifications

You can temporarily turn off alerts for specific events without deleting them by muting notifications. This is helpful when you want to avoid distractions but still have the option to reactivate the notifications later. By muting, you can control which alerts you receive, focusing only on what’s most important. 

You can mute your notifications through two different methods, as discussed below

### Method I: From User Interface

You can mute notifications directly from the user interface, which allows you to silence specific alerts while keeping them available for later. This helps reduce distractions without losing track of important information. If needed, you can unmute them at any time.

!!! note 
    Muting a notification from the User Interface will mute the entire notification rule, stopping all future notifications from that rule. 

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the bell **“🔔”** icon located in the top right navigation bar.

![bell-icon](../../../assets/notifications/manage-notifications/bell-icon-light-21.png#only-light)
![bell-icon](../../../assets/notifications/manage-notifications/bell-icon-dark-21.png#only-dark)

Here, you can view all notifications that have been triggered based on the notification rule.
