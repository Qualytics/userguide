# Notifications: Overview

Notifications in Qualytics offer a powerful system for delivering crucial alerts and updates across various communication channels. By setting up notification rules with specific triggers and channels, users can ensure timely awareness of critical events. This functionality enhances productivity, optimizes incident response, and promotes effective data management within the Qualytics platform.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Multiple Notification Channels

Qualytics emphasizes the configuration of multiple notification channels, which are crucial for ensuring that important alerts and updates reach users effectively through various platforms.

### In-App Notifications

In-app notifications in Qualytics are real-time alerts that keep users informed about various events related to their data operations and quality checks. These notifications are displayed within the Qualytics interface and cover a range of activities, including operation completions, anomaly detections, and service level agreement (SLA) status updates. 

![notifications](../../assets/notifications/notifications-light-1.png#only-light){: style="height:350px;width:350px;"}
![notifications](../../assets/notifications/notifications-dark-1.png#only-dark){: style="height:350px;width:350px;"}

### External Platforms

Qualytics allows users to choose external platforms where they want to receive notifications, enhancing integration with their existing workflows. You can: 

* Add Email Notification  
* Add HTTP Notification  
* Add Microsoft Teams Notification  
* Add Pager Duty Notification  
* Add Slack Notification  
* Add Webhook Notification

This versatility ensures that notifications are delivered through the most convenient and effective channels for each team, allowing them to stay informed and respond to real-time data quality issues. 

!!! note
	If you do not select any notification channel, by default, you will receive notifications via in-app notifications. However, if you choose any notification channel, such as Email, you will receive notifications through both your selected channel and also in-app notifications. 

!!! tip
	Qualytics provides you with multiple options for receiving notifications. You can select one or more notification channels to receive your notifications. 

## Reducing Notification Fatigue

Users can customize their notification settings to define which alerts they wish to receive and how they want to be notified. This flexibility ensures that users are only informed about relevant events, reducing notification fatigue.

For example, **‚Äúassigning tags‚Äù** while adding the notifications generates alerts regarding only those source datastores having the tags as defined while adding the notification. If the tag **‚Äúcritical‚Äù** is defined while adding the notification rule, then the notification will be generated only for source datastores having the ‚Äúcritical‚Äù tag. 

## **User Feedback Integration**

The system allows for feedback on detected anomalies, which helps refine the anomaly detection process and reduce alert fatigue. This ensures that users are only notified about the most relevant issues. Notifications are enhanced by incorporating user feedback on actions taken. 

## Navigation to Notifications

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **‚ÄúSettings‚Äù** button on the left side panel of the interface.

![global-settings](../../assets/notifications/global-settings-light-2.png#only-light)
![global-settings](../../assets/notifications/global-settings-dark-2.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** By default, you will be navigated to the **‚ÄúTags‚Äù** section. Click on the **‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù** tab.

![notifications](../../assets/notifications/notifications-light-3.png#only-light)
![notifications](../../assets/notifications/notifications-dark-3.png#only-dark)

## **Add Notification Rule**

In Qualytics, notification rules send in-app messages by default and can also notify you via external applications like **Email**, **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, and many more. This helps you stay updated on important events, like when an operation completes, even if you're not using the app. You can customize these alerts by adding datastore tags and choosing your preferred notification channels, ensuring you get timely updates.

**Step 1:** Click on the **‚ÄúAdd Notifications‚Äù** button located in the top right corner.

![add-notifications](../../assets/notifications/add-notifications-light-4.png#only-light)
![add-notifications](../../assets/notifications/add-notifications-dark-4.png#only-dark)

A modal window **‚ÄúAdd Notification Rule‚Äù** will appear providing you with fields to set notification rules.

![notification-window](../../assets/notifications/notification-window-light-5.png#only-light)
![notification-window](../../assets/notifications/notification-window-dark-5.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Enter the following details to add the notification rule.

**1. Name:** Enter a specific and descriptive title to your notification rule to easily identify its purpose.

**2. Description:** Provide a brief description of what the notification rule does or when it should trigger.

![name-description](../../assets/notifications/name-description-light.png#only-light)
![name-description](../../assets/notifications/name-description-dark.png#only-dark)

**3. Trigger When**: Select the event or condition from the dropdown menu that will trigger the notification. Below is the list of available events you can choose from:

* **Operation Completion:** This type of notification is triggered whenever an operation, such as a catalog, profile, or scan, is completed on a source datastore. Upon completion, teams are promptly notified through in-app messages and, if configured, via external notification channels such as email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and others. For example, the team is notified whenever the catalog operation is completed, helping them proceed with the profile operation on the datastore. 

* **An Anomaly is Identified:** This type of notification is triggered when any single anomaly is identified in the data. The notification message typically includes the type of anomaly detected and the datastore where it was found. It provides specific information about the anomaly type, which helps quickly understand the issue's nature.

!!! tip 
	Users can specify a minimum anomaly weight for this trigger condition. This threshold ensures that only anomalies with a weight equal to or greater than the specified value will trigger a notification. If no value is set, all detected anomalies, regardless of their weight, will generate notifications. This feature helps prioritize alerts based on the importance of the anomalies, allowing users to focus on more critical issues.  

* **Anomalies are Detected in a Table or File:** This notification is triggered when multiple anomalies are detected within a specific table or file. It includes information about the number of anomalies found and the specific scan target within the datastore. This is useful for assessing the overall health of a particular datastore. No concept of weights. 

| Factors | An Anomaly is Identified | Anomalies are Detected in a Table or File |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Trigger Event | Notifies for individual anomaly detection | Notifies for multiple anomalies within a specific table or file |
| Notification Content | Focuses on the type of anomaly and the affected datastore. | Provide a count of anomalies and specifies the scan target within the datastore. |
| Notification Targeting  | Tags, Weight or both  | Only Tags  |

* **A Freshness SLA Violation Occurs:** This type of notification is triggered when data within a datastore does not meet the defined freshness criteria, violating the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The notification message typically includes details about the extent of the violation, the specific datastore affected, and the freshness threshold that was breached. This helps the team take prompt corrective actions to ensure data timeliness and reliability.

**4.** **Message:** Enter your custom message using variables in the Message field, where you can specify the content of the notification that will be sent out. 

!!! tip
	You can write your custom notification message by utilizing the autocomplete feature. This feature allows you to easily [insert internal variables](#available-variables) such as **{{rule_name}}**, **{{container_name}}**, and **{{datastore_name}}**. As you start typing, the autocomplete will suggest and recommend relevant variables in the dropdown.

![message](../../assets/notifications/message-dark.png#only-dark)

**5. Datastore Tags:** Use the drop-down menu to **select the datastore tags**. Notifications will be generated for only those source datastores that have the datastore tags you select in this step. For example, if you select **‚Äúcritical‚Äù** datastore tag from the dropdown menu, notifications will be generated only for source datastores having the "critical" tag applied to them. 

!!! note 
	If you choose **"An Anomaly is Detected"** as the trigger condition, you'll need to define the Anomaly's Tag and set a minimum Anomaly weight. This means that only anomalies with a weight equal to or greater than the specified value will trigger a notification. If no value is set, the weight will be ignored.
