# Slack Notification

To set up Slack notifications, start by naming your notification and selecting the triggers, such as operation completion or anomaly detection. Next, add relevant tags and configure the Slack Webhook URL to connect directly to your Slack channel. Optionally, you can include a description to provide extra context for the notification.

## Navigation to Notifications

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **Settings** button on the left side panel of the interface.

**Step 2:** By default, you will be navigated to the **Tags** section. Click on the **Notifications** tab.

A modal window **Add Notification Rule** will appear providing you with fields to set notification rules.

**Step 2:** Enter the following details to add the notification rule.

**1. Name:** Enter a specific and descriptive title to your notification rule to easily identify its purpose.

**2. Description:** Provide a brief description of what the notification rule does or when it should trigger.

**3. Trigger When**: Select the event or condition from the dropdown menu that will trigger the notification. Below is the list of available events you can choose from:

- **Operation Completion:** This type of notification is triggered whenever an operation, such as a catalog, profile, or scan, is completed on a source datastore. Upon completion, teams are promptly notified through in-app messages and, if configured, via external notification channels such as email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and others. For example, the team is notified whenever the catalog operation is completed, helping them proceed with the profile operation on the datastore. 

- **An Anomaly is Identified:** This type of notification is triggered when any single anomaly is identified in the data. The notification message typically includes the type of anomaly detected and the datastore where it was found. It provides specific information about the anomaly type, which helps quickly understand the issue's nature.

!!! tip 
    Users can specify a minimum anomaly weight for this trigger condition. This threshold ensures that only anomalies with a weight equal to or greater than the specified value will trigger a notification. If no value is set, all detected anomalies, regardless of their weight, will generate notifications. This feature helps prioritize alerts based on the importance of the anomalies, allowing users to focus on more critical issues.

- **Anomalies are Detected in a Table or File:** This notification is triggered when multiple anomalies are detected within a specific table or file. It includes information about the number of anomalies found and the specific scan target within the datastore. This is useful for assessing the overall health of a particular datastore. No concept of weights. 

| Factors | An Anomaly is Identified | Anomalies are Detected in a Table or File |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Trigger Event | Notifies for individual anomaly detection | Notifies for multiple anomalies within a specific table or file |
| Notification Content | Focuses on the type of anomaly and the affected datastore. | Provide a count of anomalies and specifies the scan target within the datastore. |
| Notification Targeting  | Tags, Weight or both  | Only Tags  |

- **A Freshness SLA Violation Occurs:** This type of notification is triggered when data within a datastore does not meet the defined freshness criteria, violating the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The notification message typically includes details about the extent of the violation, the specific datastore affected, and the freshness threshold that was breached. This helps the team take prompt corrective actions to ensure data timeliness and reliability.

**4.** **Message:** Enter your custom message using variables in the Message field, where you can specify the content of the notification that will be sent out. 

!!! tip 
    You can write your custom notification message by utilizing the autocomplete feature. This feature allows you to easily insert internal variables such as **{{rule_name}}**, **{{container_name}}**, and **{{datastore_name}}**. As you start typing, the autocomplete will suggest and recommend relevant variables in the dropdown.

**5.** **Datastore Tags:** Use the drop-down menu to **select the datastore tags**. Notifications will be generated for only those source datastores that have the datastore tags you select in this step. For example, if you select **critical** datastore tag from the dropdown menu, notifications will be generated only for source datastores having the "critical" tag applied to them. 

!!! note 
    If you choose **"An Anomaly is Detected"** as the trigger condition, you'll need to define the Anomaly's Tag and set a minimum Anomaly weight. This means that only anomalies with a weight equal to or greater than the specified value will trigger a notification. If no value is set, the weight will be ignored.

## Post Results

Once youâ€™ve saved your notification rules settings, all real-time notifications will be sent to the Webhook URL address you specified, ensuring you receive them directly in your Slack Webhook.

For example when an operation is completed, or if any anomalies are detected in a table or file, a notification will be sent to the Slack Webhook you provided.This ensures you are promptly alerted to critical events or irregularities, enabling immediate action when necessary. By providing real-time updates, it helps maintain the integrity and smooth operation of your processes.
