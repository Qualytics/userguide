# Profiles

**Profiles** in Qualytics helps you explore and manage your containers and fields. With features like filtering, sorting, tagging, and detailed profiling, it provides a clear understanding of data quality and structure. This simplifies navigation and enhances data management for quick, informed decisions.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Navigation

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **Explore** button on the left side panel of the interface.

![explore](../assets/explore/profiles/explore-light.png#only-light)
![explore](../assets/explore/profiles/explore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **"Profiles"** from the Navigation Tab.

![profiles](../assets/explore/profiles/profiles-light.png#only-light)
![profiles](../assets/explore/profiles/profiles-dark.png#only-dark)

You will be navigated to the **Profiles** section. Here, you will see the data organized into two sections: **Containers** and **Fields**, allowing you to explore and analyze the datasets efficiently.

## Containers

By selecting the **Containers section**, you can explore structured datasets that are organized as either JDBC or DFS containers. JDBC containers represent tables or views within relational databases, while DFS containers include files such as CSV, JSON, or Parquet, typically stored in distributed systems like Hadoop or cloud storage.

### Explore Tables and Fields

By clicking on a specific container, users can view its associated fields, including detailed profiling information. Additionally, clicking the arrow icon on the right side of a specific container allows users to navigate directly to its corresponding table for a more in-depth exploration.

#### Explore Fields

To explore the data within a container, you can view all its fields. This allows you to gain insights into the structure and quality of the data stored in the container.

**Step 1:** Click on the specific container whose fields you want to preview.

For demonstration purposes, we have selected the Netsuite Financials container.

## Fields

By selecting the Fields section in the Qualytics platform, you can view all the fields across your data sources, including their quality scores, completeness, and metadata, for streamlined data management.

### Field Details

Field Details view in the Qualytics platform provides in-depth insights into a selected field. It displays key information, including the fieldâ€™s declared type, number of distinct values, minimum and maximum length of observed values, entropy, and unique/distinct ratio. This detailed profiling allows you to understand the field's data structure, quality, and variability, enabling better data governance and decision-making.

**Step 1:** Click on the specific field whose field details you want to preview.

![field](../assets/explore/profiles/field-light.png#only-light)
![field](../assets/explore/profiles/field-dark.png#only-dark)

A modal window will appear, providing detailed information about the selected field, such as its declared type, distinct values, length range, the Last Profile timestamp to indicate when the field was last profiled, and more.
