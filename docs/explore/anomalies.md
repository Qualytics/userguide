# Anomalies

Anomalies tab provides a quick overview of all detected anomalies across your source datastores. In Qualytics, An Anomaly refers to a dataset (record or column) that fails to meet specified data quality checks, indicating a deviation from expected standards or norms. These anomalies are identified when the data does not satisfy the applied validation criteria. You can filter and sort anomalies based on your preferences, making it easy to see which anomalies are active,  acknowledged, or archived. This section is designed to help you quickly identify and address any issues.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Categories Anomalies

Anomalies can be classified into different categories based on their status and actions taken. These categories include Open and Archived anomalies. Managing anomalies effectively helps in maintaining data integrity and ensuring quick response to issues.

### Open

By selecting **Open Anomalies**, you can view anomalies that have been detected but remain unacknowledged or unresolved. These anomalies require attention and may need further investigation or corrective action. 

![open](../assets/explore/anomalies/open-light.png#only-light)
![open](../assets/explore/anomalies/open-dark.png#only-dark)

This option helps focus on unaddressed issues while allowing seamless navigation to **All**, **Active**, or **Acknowledged** anomalies as needed.

**1. Active**: By selecting **Active Anomalies**, you can focus on anomalies that are currently unresolved or require immediate attention. These are the anomalies that are still in play and have not yet been acknowledged, archived, or resolved.

![active](../assets/explore/anomalies/active-light.png#only-light)
![active](../assets/explore/anomalies/active-dark.png#only-dark)

**2. Acknowledge**: By selecting **Acknowledged Anomalies**, you can see all anomalies that have been reviewed and marked as acknowledged. This status indicates that the anomalies have been noted, though they may still require further action.

![acknowledge](../assets/explore/anomalies/acknowledge-light.png#only-light)
![acknowledge](../assets/explore/anomalies/acknowledge-dark.png#only-dark)

**3. All**: By selecting **All Anomalies**, you can view the complete list of anomalies, regardless of their status. This option helps you get a comprehensive overview of all issues that have been detected, whether they are currently active, acknowledged, or archived.

![all](../assets/explore/anomalies/all-light.png#only-light)
![all](../assets/explore/anomalies/all-dark.png#only-dark)

### Archived

By selecting **Archived Anomalies**, you can view anomalies that have been resolved or moved out of active consideration. Archiving anomalies allows you to keep a record of past issues without cluttering the active list.

![archived](../assets/explore/anomalies/archived-light.png#only-light)
![archived](../assets/explore/anomalies/archived-dark.png#only-dark)

You can also categorize the archived anomalies based on their status as **Resolved**, **Duplicate** and **Invalid**, to review them effectively.

**1. Resolved**: This indicates that the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed.

![resolved](../assets/explore/anomalies/resolved-light.png#only-light)
![resolved](../assets/explore/anomalies/resolved-dark.png#only-dark)

**2. Duplicate**: This indicates that the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed.

![duplicate](../assets/explore/anomalies/duplicate-light.png#only-light)
![duplicate](../assets/explore/anomalies/duplicate-dark.png#only-dark)

**3. Invalid**: This indicates that the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action.

![invalid](../assets/explore/anomalies/invalid-light.png#only-light)
![invalid](../assets/explore/anomalies/invalid-dark.png#only-dark)

**4. All**: Displays all archived anomalies, including those marked as Resolved, Duplicate, and Invalid, giving a comprehensive view of all past issues.

## Anomaly Details

**Anomaly Details** window provides information about anomalies identified during scan operations. It displays details such as the anomaly ID, status, type, detection time, and where it is in the data, such as the datastore and table.  Additionally, it offers options to explore datasets, share details, and collaborate, making it easier to resolve data issues.

**Step 1:** Click on the anomaly from the list of available (whether Active, Acknowledged or Archived) anomalies to view its details.

![details](../assets/explore/anomalies/details-light.png#only-light)
![details](../assets/explore/anomalies/details-dark.png#only-dark)

A modal window titled **‚ÄúAnomaly Details‚Äù** will appear, displaying all the details of the selected anomaly.

![modal](../assets/explore/anomalies/modal-light.png#only-light)
![modal](../assets/explore/anomalies/modal-dark.png#only-dark)

For more details on Anomaly Details, please refer to the [**Anomaly Details**](../anomalies/anomalies.md#anomaly-details) section in the documentation.

## Acknowledged Anomalies

By acknowledging anomalies, you indicate that they have been reviewed or recognized. Acknowledging anomalies helps you keep track of issues that have been addressed, even if further action is still required.

!!! warning 
    Once an anomaly is acknowledged, it remains acknowledged and never reverts to the active state. 

**Step 1**: Click on the active anomaly from the list of available anomalies that you want to acknowledge.

![ackno](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-light.png#only-light)
![ackno](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** A modal window will appear displaying the anomaly details. Click on the **acknowledge (üëÅ)** icon located in the upper-right corner of the modal window.

![ackno-window](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-window-light.png#only-light)
![ackno-window](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-window-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3:** After clicking on the **Acknowledge** icon your anomaly is successfully moved to the acknowledge and a flash message will appear saying ‚Äú**The Anomaly has been successfully acknowledged‚Äù.**

## Archive Anomalies

By archiving anomalies, you move them to an inactive state, while still keeping them available for future reference or analysis. Archiving helps keep your active anomaly list clean without permanently deleting the records.

**Step 1**: Click on the anomaly from the list of available (whether Active or Acknowledged) anomalies that you want to archive.

![archived](../assets/explore/anomalies/archieve-ano-light.png#only-light)
![archived](../assets/explore/anomalies/archieve-ano-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** A modal window will appear displaying the anomaly details. Click on the **archive (üóë)** icon located in the upper-right corner of the modal window.

![window](../assets/explore/anomalies/window-archive-light.png#only-light)
![window](../assets/explore/anomalies/window-archive-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3:** A modal window titled **‚ÄúArchive Anomaly‚Äù** will appear, providing you with the following archive options:

* **Resolved**: Choose this option if the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed. This helps maintain a record of resolved issues while ensuring that they are no longer active.

* **Duplicate**: Choose this option if the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed. No further action is required as the issue has been previously resolved.

* **Invalid**: Select this option if the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action. Archiving anomalies as invalid helps differentiate between real issues and those that can be dismissed, improving overall data quality management.

## Delete Anomalies

Deleting an anomaly allows you to permanently remove a record that is no longer relevant or was logged in error. This action is done individually, ensuring that your anomaly records remain clean and up to date.

!!! note 
    You can only delete archived anomalies, not active or acknowledged checks. If you want to delete an active or acknowledged anomaly, you must first move it to the archive, and then you can delete it. 

You can delete individual anomalies using one of two methods:

### **1. Delete Directly** 

**Step 1:** Click on **Archived** from the **navigation bar** in the **Anomalies** section to view all archived anomalies.
