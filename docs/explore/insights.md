## **Understanding Timeframes and Timeslices**

When analyzing data on the Insights, two key concepts help you uncover trends: **timeframes** and **timeslices**. These work together to give you both a broad view and a detailed breakdown of your data.

## **Timeframes**

**Timeframe** is the total range of time you select to view your data. For example, you can choose to see data:

* **Weekly**: Summarize data for an entire week.

* **Monthly**: Group data by months.

* **Quarterly**: Cover three months at a time.

* **Yearly**: Show data for the entire year.

### **How Metrics Behave Over a Timeframe** 

* **Quality Score** and other similar metrics display an **average** for the selected timeframe.

**Example:**If you select **weekly**, the Quality Score shown will be the **average score for the entire week**.

![average](../assets/explore/insights/average-light.png)

* **Historical Graphs** (like **Profiles** or **Scans**) show **cumulative totals** over time.

**Example:**If you view a graph for a **monthly timeframe**, the graph shows how data grows or changes month by month.

![monthly](../assets/explore/insights/monthly-light.png)

## **Timeslices**

**Timeslice** breaks your selected timeframe into smaller parts. It helps you see more detailed trends within the overall timeframe.

For example:

* A **weekly timeframe** shows each day of the week.

* A **monthly timeframe** breaks into weekly segments.

* A **quarterly timeframe** highlights months within that quarter.

* A **yearly timeframe** divides into quarters and months.

### **How Timeslices Work**

* When you choose a timeframe, the graph automatically breaks it into timeslices.

* Each bar or point on the graph represents one **timeslice**.
    
**Example:**

* If you choose a **Weekly timeframe**, each bar in the graph will represent one **day** of the week.

![weekly](../assets/explore/insights/weekly-light.png)

* If you choose a **Monthly timeframe**, each bar will represent one **week** in that month.

![week](../assets/explore/insights/week-light.png)

### **Metrics Within a Timeslice** 

Metrics like Quality Score, Profiles, or Scans are displayed for each timeslice, allowing you to identify trends and patterns over smaller intervals.

## Quality Score

**Quality Score** gives a clear view of your data's overall quality. It shows important measures like [**Completeness**](../glossary.md#completeness), [**Conformity**](../glossary.md#conformity), [**Consistency**](../glossary.md#consistency), [**Precision**](../glossary.md#precision), [**Timeliness**](../glossary.md#timeliness), [**Volumetrics**](../glossary.md#volumetrics), and [**Accuracy**](../glossary.md#accuracy), each represented by a percentage. This helps you quickly understand the health of your data, making it easier to identify areas that need improvement.
