# Observability

**Observability** in the Explore section offers a clear view of platform data, enabling users to monitor and analyze data behavior effectively. It tracks changes in data volumes and metrics, highlighting trends and anomalies. By organizing checks into Volumetric and Metric categories, it simplifies monitoring overall data volumes and specific field-based values. Visual tools like heatmaps and customizable checks make it easy to identify issues, set thresholds, and adjust monitoring parameters for efficient data management.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Observability Categorized

Observability, data checks are divided into two categories: Volumetric and Metric. Volumetric checks track overall data volume, while Metric checks measures data based on predefined fields and thresholds, tracking changes in data values over time. These two categories work together to offer comprehensive insights into data trends and anomalies.

![category](../assets/explore/observability/category-light.png#only-light)
![category](../assets/explore/observability/categoryy-dark.png#only-dark)

**1. Volumetric:** Volumetric automatically tracks changes in the amount of data within a table over time. It monitors row counts and compares them to expected ranges based on historical data. If the data volume increases or decreases unexpectedly, the check flags it for further review. This feature helps users easily identify unusual data patterns without manual monitoring.

![volumetric](../assets/explore/observability/volumetric-light.png#only-light)
![volumetric](../assets/explore/observability/volumetric-dark.png#only-dark)

**2. Metric:** Metric measures data based on predefined fields and thresholds, tracking changes in data values over time. It detects if the value of a specific field, like the average or absolute value, goes beyond the expected range. Using scheduled scans, it automatically records and analyzes these values, helping users quickly spot any anomalies. This check gives deeper insights into data behavior, ensuring data integrity and identifying irregular patterns easily.

## Volumetric

Volumetric help monitor data volumes over time to keep data accurate and reliable. They automatically count rows in a table and spot any unusual changes, like problems with data loading. This makes it easier to catch issues early and keep everything running smoothly. Volumetric checks also let you track data over different time periods, like daily or weekly. The system sets limits based on past data, and if the row count goes above or below those limits, an anomaly alert is triggered.

### Observability Heatmap

The heatmap provides a visual overview of data anomalies by day, using color codes for quick understanding:

* **Blue square**: Blue square represent days with no anomalies, meaning data stayed within the expected range.

* **Orange square**: Orange square indicate days where data exceeded the minimum or maximum threshold range but didnâ€™t qualify as a critical anomaly.

* **Red square**: Red square highlight days with anomalies, signaling significant deviations from expected values that need further investigation.

![heatmap](../assets/explore/observability/heatmap-light.png#only-light)
![heatmap](../assets/explore/observability/heatmap-dark.png#only-dark)

By hovering over each square, you can view additional details for that specific day, including the **date**, **last row count**, and **anomaly count**, allowing you to easily pinpoint and analyze data issues over time.

### Edit Threshold

Edit thresholds to set specific row count limits for your data checks. By defining minimum and maximum values, you ensure alerts are triggered when data goes beyond the expected range. This helps you monitor unusual changes in data volume. It gives you better control over tracking your data's behavior.

!!! note 
    When Editing the threshold, only the min and max values can be modified. 

**Step 1:**  Click the **Edit Thresholds** button on the right side of the graph.

## Metric

Metric track changes in data over time to ensure accuracy and reliability. They check specific fields against set limits to identify when values, like averages, go beyond expected ranges. With scheduled scans, Metrics automatically log and analyze these data points, making it easy for users to spot any issues. This functionality enhances users' understanding of data patterns, ensuring high quality and dependability. With Metrics, managing and monitoring data becomes straightforward and efficient.

| 19 | Group By  | This option lets users group data by periods like **Day,** **Week,** or **Month**. In this example, it's set to **Day.**  |

### Comparisons

When you add a metric check, you can choose from three comparison options:

* Absolute Change  
* Absolute Value  
* Percentage Change.

These options help define how the system will evaluate your data during scan operations on the datastore.

Once a scan is run, the system analyzes the data based on the selected comparison type. For example, Absolute Change will look for significant differences between scans, Absolute Value checks if the data falls within a predefined range, and Percentage Change identifies shifts in data as a percentage.

Based on the chosen comparison type, the system flags any deviations from the defined thresholds. These deviations are then visually represented on a chart, displaying how the metric has fluctuated over time between scans. If the data crosses the upper or lower limits during any scan, the system will highlight this in the chart for further analysis.

**1. Absolute Change:** The Absolute Change comparison checks how much a numeric field's value has changed between scans. If the change exceeds a set limit (Min/Max), it flags this as an anomaly.

![absolute](../assets/explore/observability/absolute-light.png#only-light)
![absolute](../assets/explore/observability/absolute-dark.png#only-dark)

**2. Absolute Value:** The Absolute Value comparison checks whether a numeric field's value falls within a defined range (between Min and Max) during each scan. If the value goes beyond this range, it identifies it as an anomaly.

![value](../assets/explore/observability/value-light.png#only-light)
![value](../assets/explore/observability/value-dark.png#only-dark)

**3. Percentage Change:** The Percentage Change comparison monitors how much a numeric field's value has shifted in percentage terms. If the change surpasses the set percentage threshold between scans, it triggers an anomaly.
