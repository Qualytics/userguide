# Observability

Observability provides a structured way to monitor data behavior, detect anomalies, and identify trends across datastores and tables. It supports consistent tracking through **Measures** and **Metrics**, including daily data volumes, data freshness, and specific field-level values measured against predefined thresholds. Automated scans, heatmaps, and visual insights make it easier to spot issues, set thresholds, and adjust monitoring settings to maintain data integrity.
