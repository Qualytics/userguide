### 2023.06.20 { id="2023.06.20 }

#### Feature Enhancements

- Reworked Tags View
    - Improved the usability and visual appeal of the tags view. Added new properties like description and weight modifier to provide more detailed information and assign relative importance to tags. The weight value directly correlates with the level of importance, where a higher weight indicates higher significance.

- Inherited Tags Support

### 2023.06.12 { id="2023.06.12" }

#### Feature Enhancements

- [**Explore**](/userguide/explore/global-explore/) is the new centralized view of Activities, Containers (Profiles, Tables, Computed Tables), Checks, Anomalies and Insights across ALL Datastores. This new view allows for filtering by Datastores & Tags, which will persist the filters across all of the submenu tabs. The goal is to help with Critical Data Elements and filtering out irrelevant information.
- Enhanced Navigation Features
    - The navigation tabs have been refined for increased user-friendliness.
    - Enhanced the Profile View and added toggle between card and list views.
    - `Datastores` and `Enrichment Datastores` have been unified, with a tabular view introduced to distinguish between your Source Datastores and Enrichment Datastores.
    - `Explore` has been added to the main navigation, and `Insights` has been conveniently relocated into the Explore submenu.
    - Renamed `Tables/Files` to `Profiles` in the Datastore details page.

#### Added Support

- We're thrilled to introduce two new checks, the `Absolute Change Limit` and the `Relative Change Limit`, tailored to augment data change monitoring. These checks enable users to set thresholds on their numeric data fields and monitor fluctuations from one scan to the next. If the changes breach the predefined limits, an anomaly is generated. 

    - ![Screenshot](assets/changelog/absolute-relative-change-limit.png#only-light){: style="height:100px"}
    ![Screenshot](assets/changelog/absolute-relative-change-limit.png#only-dark){: style="height:100px"}
    - The [`Absolute Change Limit`](/userguide/checks/absolute-change-limit-check) check is designed to monitor changes in a field's value by a fixed amount. If the field's value changes by more than the specified limit since the last applicable scan, an anomaly is generated.
    - The [`Relative Change Limit`](/userguide/checks/relative-change-limit-check) check works similarly but tracks changes in terms of percentages. If the change in a field's value exceeds the defined percentage limit since the last applicable scan, an anomaly is generated.

    - The API now supports tuning operations by allowing users to set a higher correlation threshold for profiles.
    - It also enables users to set a higher count rollup threshold for anomalies in scan.
    - This customization capability helps users fine-tune the behavior of the system according to their specific needs and preferences.

### 2023.04.07 { id="2023.04.07" }

#### Feature Enhancements

- We've just deployed an MVP version of the Freshness Dashboard! This feature lets you create, manage, and monitor all of the SLAs for each of your datastores and their child files/tables/containers, all in one place. It's like having a birds-eye view of how your datastores are doing in relation to their freshness.
    - To access the Freshness Dashboard, just locate and click on the clock icon in the top navigation between Insights and Anomalies. By default, you'll see a rollup of all the datastores in a list view with their child files/tables/containers collapsed. Simply click on a datastore row to expand the list.
- We've also made some improvements to the UI, including more sorting and filtering options in Datastores, Files/Tables, Checks, and Anomalies. Plus, we've added the ability to search the description field in checks, making it easier to find what you're looking for.
- And last but not least, we've added a cool new feature to checks - the ability to archive ALL anomalies generated by a check. Simply click on the anomaly warning icon at the top of the check details box to bring up the archive anomalies dialog box.
