- We've just deployed an MVP version of the Freshness Dashboard! This feature lets you create, manage, and monitor all of the SLAs for each of your datastores and their child files/tables/containers, all in one place. It's like having a birds-eye view of how your datastores are doing in relation to their freshness.
    - To access the Freshness Dashboard, just locate and click on the clock icon in the top navigation between Insights and Anomalies. By default, you'll see a rollup of all the datastores in a list view with their child files/tables/containers collapsed. Simply click on a datastore row to expand the list.
- We've also made some improvements to the UI, including more sorting and filtering options in Datastores, Files/Tables, Checks, and Anomalies. Plus, we've added the ability to search the description field in checks, making it easier to find what you're looking for.
- And last but not least, we've added a cool new feature to checks - the ability to archive ALL anomalies generated by a check. Simply click on the anomaly warning icon at the top of the check details box to bring up the archive anomalies dialog box.
