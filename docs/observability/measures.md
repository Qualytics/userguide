# Measures

Measures focus on monitoring overall data trends to ensure consistency and reliability. This includes Volumetric Checks, which track data volume to identify trends and detect anomalies, and Freshness Tracking, which measures the last update or addition of data to ensure timeliness. These checks help maintain data integrity by highlighting unexpected changes in volume or delays in data updates.This category includes two key checks:

## Volumetric

Volumetric help monitor data volumes over time to keep data accurate and reliable. They automatically count rows in a table and spot any unusual changes, like problems with data loading.

For more information please, refer to the [volumetric documentation](../observability/volumetric.md).

## Freshness

This measures the timeliness of data by monitoring when new data was last added or updated. It helps ensure that data remains up-to-date and relevant for decision-making.

For more information please, refer to the [freshness documentation](../observability/freshness.md).
