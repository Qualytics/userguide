# Observability

Observability gives users an easy way to track changes in data volume over time. It introduces two types of checks: **Volumetric** and **Metric.** The Volumetric check automatically monitors the number of rows in a table and flags unusual changes, while the Metric check focuses on specific fields, providing more detailed insights from scan operations. Together, these tools help users spot data anomalies quickly and keep their data accurate.

## Observability Categories

Observability, data checks are divided into two categories: Volumetric and Metric. Volumetric checks track overall data volume, while Metric checks focus on specific data attributes. These two categories work together to offer comprehensive insights into data trends and anomalies.

![category](../assets/observability/category-light-3.png#only-light)
![category](../assets/observability/category-dark-3.png#only-dark)

**1. Volumetric:** Volumetric is a tool that automatically tracks changes in the amount of data within a table over time. It monitors row counts and compares them to expected ranges based on historical data. If the data volume increases or decreases unexpectedly, the check flags it for further review. This feature helps users easily identify unusual data patterns without manual monitoring.

![volumetric](../assets/observability/volumetric-light-4.png#only-light)
![volumetric](../assets/observability/volumetric-dark-4.png#only-dark)

**2. Metric:** Metric measures data based on predefined fields and thresholds, tracking changes in data values over time. It detects if the value of a specific field, like the average or absolute value, goes beyond the expected range. Using scheduled scans, it automatically records and analyzes these values, helping users quickly spot any anomalies. This check gives deeper insights into data behavior, ensuring data integrity and identifying irregular patterns easily.

### Volumetric

Volumetric help monitor data volumes over time to keep data accurate and reliable. They automatically count rows in a table and spot any unusual changes, like problems with data loading. This makes it easier to catch issues early and keep everything running smoothly. Volumetric checks also let you track data over different time periods, like daily or weekly. The system sets limits based on past data, and if the row count goes above or below those limits, an anomaly alert is triggered.

### Comparisons

When you [add a metric](https://userguide.qualytics.io/checks/metric-check/) check, you can choose from three comparison options: 

* Absolute Change  
* Absolute Value  
* Percentage Change. 

These options help define how the system will evaluate your data during scan operations on the datastore.

Once a scan is run, the system analyzes the data based on the selected comparison type. For example, Absolute Change will look for significant differences between scans, Absolute Value checks if the data falls within a predefined range, and Percentage Change identifies shifts in data as a percentage.

Based on the chosen comparison type, the system flags any deviations from the defined thresholds. These deviations are then visually represented on a chart, displaying how the metric has fluctuated over time between scans. If the data crosses the upper or lower limits during any scan, the system will highlight this in the chart for further analysis.

**1. Absolute Change:** The Absolute Change comparison checks how much a numeric field's value has changed between scans. If the change exceeds a set limit (Min/Max), it flags this as an anomaly.

![observability](../assets/observability/change-light-23.png#only-light)
![observability](../assets/observability/change-dark-23.png#only-dark)

**2. Absolute Value:** The Absolute Value comparison checks whether a numeric field's value falls within a defined range (between Min and Max) during each scan. If the value goes beyond this range, it identifies it as an anomaly.

![observability](../assets/observability/value-light-24.png#only-light)
![observability](../assets/observability/value-dark-24.png#only-dark)

**3. Percentage Change:** The Percentage Change comparison monitors how much a numeric field's value has shifted in percentage terms. If the change surpasses the set percentage threshold between scans, it triggers an anomaly.
