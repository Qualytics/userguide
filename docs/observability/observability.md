# Observability

Observability helps users track changes in data volume and quality over time, ensuring data accuracy and integrity. Within the Source Datastore section, the Observability tab provides visibility into observability metrics across tables or files within a specific datastore. It introduces two main categories: **Measures** and **Metric** Checks. Measures include **Volumetric Checks**, which monitor fluctuations in row counts, and **Freshness Tracking**, which ensures data is updated on time. **Metric Checks** focus on specific fields and offer deeper insights derived from scan operations. These tools work together to help detect anomalies early and maintain the reliability of your data assets.

Users can access the Observability tab in the Source Datastore section to analyze particular datastore in detail. However, to get an overview of observability metrics across multiple source datastores and tables, navigate to the [**Observability**](../explore/observability.md) documentation for centralized overview of data behavior across your entire environment.

## Observability Categories

Observability in data checks is divided into two key categories: **Measures** and **Metric Checks**. Measures focus on overall data trends and include **Volumetric Checks**, which monitor data volume to identify trends and anomalies, and **Freshness Tracking**, which tracks when data was last added or updated to ensure timeliness. **Metric Checks**, on the other hand, analyze specific data attributes, providing detailed insights into data quality.

![category](../assets/observability/category-dark-3.png#only-dark)

**1. Measures:** Measures focus on monitoring overall data trends to ensure consistency and reliability. This includes **Volumetric Checks**, which track data volume to identify trends and detect anomalies, and **Freshness** Tracking, which measures the last update or addition of data to ensure timeliness. These checks help maintain data integrity by highlighting unexpected changes in volume or delays in data updates.

![volumetric](../assets/observability/volumetric-light-4.png#only-light)
![volumetric](../assets/observability/volumetric-dark-4.png#only-dark)

**2. Metric:** Metric measures data based on predefined fields and thresholds, tracking changes in data values over time. It detects if the value of a specific field, like the average or absolute value, goes beyond the expected range. Using scheduled scans, it automatically records and analyzes these values, helping users quickly spot any anomalies. This check gives deeper insights into data behavior, ensuring data integrity and identifying irregular patterns easily.

## **Measures**

**Measures** focus on tracking overall data trends to ensure stability, consistency, and reliability. This category includes two key checks:

### Volumetric

Volumetric help monitor data volumes over time to keep data accurate and reliable. They automatically count rows in a table and spot any unusual changes, like problems with data loading. This makes it easier to catch issues early and keep everything running smoothly. Volumetric checks also let you track data over different time periods, like daily or weekly. The system sets limits based on past data, and if the row count goes above or below those limits, an anomaly alert is triggered.

![details](../assets/observability/volumetric-detail-light-6.png#only-light)
![detail](../assets/observability/volumetric-detail-dark-6.png#only-dark)

| 16 |  Max Values | These indicate the maximum thresholds for the row count of the table being checked. |
| 17 |  Last Asserted | This shows the date the last check was asserted, which is the last time the system evaluated the Volumetric Check (e.g., Oct 02, 2024). |
| 18 | Edit Threshold | Edit Threshold lets users set custom limits for alerts, helping them control when they‚Äôre notified about changes in data. |
| 19. | Graph Visualization | The graph provides a visual representation of the row count trends. It shows fluctuations in data volume over the selected period. This visual allows users to quickly identify any irregularities or anomalies. |

### Observability Heatmap

The heatmap provides a visual overview of data anomalies by day, using color codes for quick understanding:

![heatmap-square](../assets/observability/heatmap-light.png#only-light)
![heatmap-square](../assets/observability/heatmap-dark.png#only-dark)

- **Blue square**: Blue square represent days with no anomalies, meaning data stayed within the expected range.
- **Orange square**: Orange square indicate days where data exceeded the minimum or maximum threshold range but didn‚Äôt qualify as a critical anomaly.
- **Red square**: Red square highlight days with anomalies, signaling significant deviations from expected values that need further investigation.

![heatmap-square](../assets/observability/hover-light.png#only-light)
![heatmap-square](../assets/observability/hover-dark.png#only-dark)

By hovering over each square, you can view additional details for that specific day, including the **date**, **anomaly count**, **last row count**,and **last modification time** allowing you to easily pinpoint and analyze data issues over time.

### Edit Check

### Metric

Metric track changes in data over time to ensure accuracy and reliability. They check specific fields against set limits to identify when values, like averages, go beyond expected ranges. With scheduled scans, Metrics automatically log and analyze these data points, making it easy for users to spot any issues. This functionality enhances users' understanding of data patterns, ensuring high quality and dependability. With Metrics, managing and monitoring data becomes straightforward and efficient.

![observability](../assets/observability/metric-detail-light-22.png#only-light)
![observability](../assets/observability/metric-detail-dark-22.png#only-dark)

| No | Field | Description |

| 16 | Group By  | This option lets users group data by periods like **Day,** **Week,** or **Month**. In this example, it's set to **Day.**  |

### Comparisons

When you [add a metric](https://userguide.qualytics.io/checks/metric-check/) check, you can choose from three comparison options:

* Absolute Change  
* Absolute Value  
* Percentage Change

These options help define how the system will evaluate your data during scan operations on the datastore.

Once a scan is run, the system analyzes the data based on the selected comparison type. For example, Absolute Change will look for significant differences between scans, Absolute Value checks if the data falls within a predefined range, and Percentage Change identifies shifts in data as a percentage.

Based on the chosen comparison type, the system flags any deviations from the defined thresholds. These deviations are then visually represented on a chart, displaying how the metric has fluctuated over time between scans. If the data crosses the upper or lower limits during any scan, the system will highlight this in the chart for further analysis.

**1. Absolute Change:** The Absolute Change comparison checks how much a numeric field's value has changed between scans. If the change exceeds a set limit (Min/Max), it flags this as an anomaly.

![observability](../assets/observability/change-light-23.png#only-light)
![observability](../assets/observability/change-dark-23.png#only-dark)

**2. Absolute Value:** The Absolute Value comparison checks whether a numeric field's value falls within a defined range (between Min and Max) during each scan. If the value goes beyond this range, it identifies it as an anomaly.

![observability](../assets/observability/value-light-24.png#only-light)
![observability](../assets/observability/value-dark-24.png#only-dark)

**3. Percentage Change:** The Percentage Change comparison monitors how much a numeric field's value has shifted in percentage terms. If the change surpasses the set percentage threshold between scans, it triggers an anomaly.

![observability](../assets/observability/percentage-light-25.png#only-light)
![observability](../assets/observability/percentage-dark-25.png#only-dark)

### Minimum Measurements for Chart Rendering

To display metric charts in the UI, a minimum number of measurements must be recorded. If the required number of measurements is not met, the chart remains empty even though some measurements exist.

* **Absolute Value:** Requires at least 2 measurements to render.

* **Absolute Change:** Requires at least 3 measurements to render.

* **Percentage Change:** Requires at least 3 measurements to render.

These thresholds ensure meaningful visual representation by preventing incomplete or misleading chart data.

### Edit Check

    When editing the threshold, only the min and max values can be modified.
