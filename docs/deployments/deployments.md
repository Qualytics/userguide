# Deployment Options

### **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**

As an active data quality monitoring solution, Qualytics offers a dynamic Platform as a Service (PaaS) option. This solution provides a robust platform for actively monitoring your data quality. With our single-tenant PaaS offering, you can concentrate the quality of your data, while we handle the underlying infrastructure and its consistent maintenance.

### **Hybrid Deployment:**
Qualytics caters to diverse infrastructure needs with our hybrid deployment option. This model merges the best of both worlds by combining on-premises and cloud infrastructure. With our hybrid model, you can enjoy the enhanced control and security of an on-premises setup, coupled with the flexibility and scalability of cloud services.

### **On-Premises Deployment:**
For clients who prefer complete control and security, Qualytics provides an on-premises deployment model. In this scenario, our software runs on your company's servers, with your team managing all related hardware and network infrastructure. While this model requires more resources for upkeep, it delivers maximum control over data and processes, perfectly suiting businesses with rigorous security requirements.
