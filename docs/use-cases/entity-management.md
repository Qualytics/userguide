# Entity Management with Metadata Analysis

## Overview

This use case focuses on profiling data, generating metadata, and gaining insights for enhanced entity management and resolution using Qualytics.

## Goal

The primary objective is to improve entity management and resolution efforts through data profiling, metadata generation, and insightful analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the dataset you want to profile
- Familiarity with Qualytics' data profiling and metadata generation features

## Steps

1. Set up connections to the Datastores in Qualytics by selecting "Add a Datastore" from Datastore Operations
2. Run a Profile Operation on your desired Datastore
3. Analyze the generated metadata to gain valuable insights about your data.
4. Use these insights to inform your entity management and resolution strategies.
5. Use API to export into PowerBI.

## Expected Outcome

Upon successful implementation of this use case, you should be able to more effectively manage and resolve entities in your data, informed by the insights gained from data profiling and metadata analysis.

## Troubleshooting

If the histogram diff reveals significant discrepancies between values that should be equivalent, revisit your data profiling process to ensure it's accurately capturing the characteristics of your data.
