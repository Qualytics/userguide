# SSO (Single Sign-On)

Qualytics platform harnesses the power of Okta's Single Sign-On (SSO) technology to create a frictionless authentication journey for our users. Once users have successfully logged in to Qualytics, they can conveniently access all linked external applications and services without the need for additional sign-ins. Depending on the application and its compatibility with federated SSO protocols such as SAML, OIDC, or any proprietary authentication methods, Qualytics, with the help of Okta, establishes a secure connection for user authentication. In essence, SSO allows one central domain to authenticate and then share the session across various other domains. The method of sharing may vary between SSO protocols, but the principle remains constant.

  

Through Okta's Integration Network (OIN), Qualytics extends SSO access to an extensive range of supported cloud-based applications. These integrations can utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML, SWA, or proprietary APIs for SSO. Maintenance of SSO protocols and provisioning APIs is reliably managed by Okta.

  

In addition to this, Qualytics also leverages Okta's capabilities to provide SSO integrations for on-premises web-based applications. You have the option to integrate these applications via SWA or SAML toolkits. In addition, Okta supports user provisioning and deprovisioning with applications that publicly offer their provisioning APIs.

  

Further enhancing our SSO integrations, Qualytics provides seamless access to mobile applications. Whether they are web applications optimized for mobile devices, native iOS apps, or Android apps, users can access web app integrations in the OIN using SSO from any mobile device. These mobile web apps can employ industry-standard OIDC, SAML, or Okta SWA technologies. To illustrate, Qualytics, in conjunction with Okta, can integrate with native applications such as Box Mobile using SAML for registration and OAuth for continuous use.
