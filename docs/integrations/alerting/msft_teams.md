# Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams integration in Qualytics enables seamless communication by connecting your Microsoft Teams workspace with data quality updates and notifications. It involves configuring Azure resources, providing necessary credentials, and establishing a direct link to your Teams workspace for alerts and communication.

Let's get started ðŸš€

## Microsoft Teams Setup Guide

This section provides a comprehensive walkthrough to help you configure the necessary resources and retrieve the required credentials. By following this setup process, you'll have everything you need to complete the integration form.

!!! warning
    Some steps in this guide may require administrator privileges in your Microsoft Azure environment. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you might need to coordinate with your IT department or someone with administrative access to your Azure tenant.

### Creating a Microsoft Entra App Registration

The Microsoft Entra App Registration is used by Qualytics to provision Teams bot resources in your environment.

**Step 1:** Log in to to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Entra App Registrations</a>, and select New registration from the main menu to create a new application.
