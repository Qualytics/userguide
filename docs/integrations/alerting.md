# Alerting Integrations

The Qualytics platform integrates with popular enterprise messaging platforms, such as [Slack](./alerting/slack.md) and [Microsoft Teams](./alerting/msft_teams.md) to enable real-time communication about data quality events. These integrations help ensure that your teams remain informed and can respond quickly when data issues occur.

-  Receive instant notifications when data quality issues are detected
-  Alert relevant team members about failed quality checks in real-time
-  Share operational status updates and system health notifications
-  Configure custom alerts based on data quality thresholds and conditions
-  Route notifications to specific channels or teams based on data context

These integrations ensure your teams stay informed about data quality events as they happen, enabling rapid response and maintaining continuous data quality awareness across your organization.
