# Ticketing Integrations

The Qualytics platform seamlessly integrates with enterprise ticketing and project management solutions, enabling teams to:

-  Track and manage data quality anomalies within their existing workflow tools
-  Automatically create and update tickets when quality issues are detected
-  Sync status changes bidirectionally between Qualytics and ticketing systems
-  Incorporate data quality management into standard project planning processes
-  Maintain a unified view of data quality initiatives alongside other work items

This integration capability ensures that data quality management becomes a natural part of your team's established workflows rather than a separate process to manage.
