# What is a QFS?

* A `QFS` or `Qualytics FileSystem` is a datastore option that Qualytics manages & controls.  

* This is convenient for end-users who do not have or do not wish to configure their own datastores but would like to load data onto a datastore managed by Qualytics. 

* With a QFS datastore, end-users are able to upload Qualytics readable files (Excel, CSVs, Json) directly through the Qualytics user-interface.
