Once the form is completed, it's necessary to test the connection to verify if Qualytics is able to connect to your source of data. A successful message will be shown:

!!! warning 
    By clicking on the `Finish` button, it will create the Datastore and skipping the configuration of an Enrichment Datastore.

    - To configure an Enrichment Datastore in another moment, please refer [to this section](/userguide/enrichment/create-enrichment-datastore/)

!!! note 
    It is important to associate an `Enrichment Datastore` with your new Datastore

    - The `Enrichment Datastore` will allow Qualytics to record `enrichment data`, copies of the source `anomalous data` and additional `metadata` for your `Datastore`

## Configuring an Enrichment Datastore

- If you have an `Enrichment Datastore` already setup, you can link it by enable to use an existing Enrichment Datastore and select from the list

- If you don't have an `Enrichment Datastore`, you can create one at the same page:
