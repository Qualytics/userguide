Once the form is completed, it's necessary to test the connection to verify if Qualytics is able to connect to your source of data. A successful message will be shown:

!!! info 
    We strongly recommend you to enforce an `Enrichment Datastore`

    - The `Enrichment Datastore` will allow Qualytics App to record `enrichment data`, `anomalous data` and `metadata` for your `Datastore`

    - To configure an Enrichment Datastore, please see more  [clicking here](/userguide/enrichment/associate-enrichment-datastore/)
