# Draft Archived Checks

You can draft archived checks individually or in bulk.

## Method I: Draft Specific Check

**Step 1:** Navigate to the **Archived** checks section. Click the vertical ellipsis (⋮) next to the archived check you want to move to the draft state, and select **"Draft"** from the dropdown menu.

For demonstration purposes, we have selected the **"Not Null"** check.
