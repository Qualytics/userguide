# Checks in Datastore

Checks are validation rules applied to datasets to ensure data quality and integrity. They can be categorized as Active, Draft, or Archived based on their status and usage. Each check includes detailed metadata such as importance, scan history, anomalies, and assertion results. This section guides you through viewing, managing, and analyzing these checks within your datastore.

Let's get started ðŸš€

## Navigation

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your checks.

![datastore](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/datastore-light-1.png)

**Step 2:** Click on the **"Checks"** from the Navigation Tab.

![checks](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/checks-light-2.png)

## Categories Checks

You can categorize your checks based on their status, such as Active, Draft, Archived (Invalid and Discarded), or All, according to your preference. This categorization offers a clear view of the data quality validation process, helping you manage checks efficiently and maintain data integrity.

### All

By selecting **All Checks**, you can view a comprehensive list of all the checks in the datastore, including both **active** and **draft** checks, allowing you to focus on the checks that are currently being managed or are in progress. However, archived checks are not displayed in this.  

![all](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/all-light-3.png)

### Active

By selecting **Active**, you can view checks that are currently applied and being enforced on the data. These operational checks are used to validate data quality in real time, allowing you to monitor all active checks and their performance.

![active](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/active-light-4.png)

You can also categorize the active checks based on their importance and favorites to streamline your data quality monitoring.

**1. Important:** Shows only checks that are marked as important. These checks are prioritized based on their significance, typically assigned a weight of 7 or higher.

!!! note
    Important checks are prioritized based on a weight of 7 or higher.

**2. Favorite:** Displays checks that have been marked as favorites. This allows you to quickly access checks that you use or monitor frequently.

![favorite](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/favorite-light-6.png)

**3. All:** Displays a comprehensive view of all active checks, including important, favorite, and any checks that do not fall under these specific categories.

![all](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/all-light-8.png)

### Draft Checks

By selecting **Draft**, you can view checks that have been created but have not yet been applied to the data. These checks are in the drafting stage, allowing for adjustments and reviews before activation. Draft checks provide flexibility to experiment with different validation rules without affecting the actual data.

![draft](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/draft-light-9.png)

You can also categorize the draft checks based on their importance and favorites to prioritize and organize them effectively during the review and adjustment process.

**1. Important:** Shows only checks that are marked as important. These checks are prioritized based on their significance, typically assigned a weight of 7 or higher. 

![important](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/important-light-10.png)

**2. Favorite:** Displays checks that have been marked as favorites. This allows you to quickly access checks that you use or monitor frequently.  

![favorite](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/favorite-light-11.png)

**3. All:** Displays a comprehensive view of all draft checks, including important, favorite, and any checks that do not fall under these specific categories.

![all](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/all-light-13.png)

### Archived Checks

By selecting **Archived**, you can view checks that have been marked as discarded or invalid from use but are still stored for future reference or restoration. Although these checks are no longer active, they can be restored if needed.

![archived](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/archived-light-14.png)

You can also categorize the archived checks based on their status as **Discarded**, **Invalid**, or view **All** archived checks to manage and review them effectively.

**1. Discarded**: Shows checks that have been marked as no longer useful or relevant and have been discarded from use.

![discarded](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/discarded-light-15.png)

**2. Invalid**: Displays checks that are deemed invalid due to errors or misconfigurations, requiring review or deletion.

![invalid](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/invalid-light-16.png)

**3. All**: Provides a view of all archived checks within this category, including discarded and invalid checks.

* **Month** â€“ Displays daily or weekly assertions throughout the selected month.

* **Quarter** â€“ Covers a three-month range (e.g., Q1: Janâ€“Mar, Q2: Aprâ€“Jun), useful for quarterly reporting and insights.

* **Year** â€“ Presents assertion data trends for an entire calendar year, allowing for broad, high-level performance monitoring.

![select-time](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/select-time-light.png)

Once a timeframe is selected, the Assertion Over Time chart below will automatically adjust to reflect assertion activity within the chosen window.

### Properties Section

The Properties section explains where this check is applied. In this case, the check is applied to a table called **supplier**, specifically to the **s_comment** field of type **String**. There is no filter added, so the check is applied to all rows in the table. This helps maintain clean and trustworthy data, especially when phone numbers must be unique per customer.

![properties](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/properties-light-98.png)

### Activity Section

The **Activity** section displays a chronological history of all actions performed on the quality check, including creation, updates, and automated adjustments. It provides visibility into how the check has evolved over time, capturing the exact configuration, properties, and tags associated with each event.

![activity](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/activity-light-98.png)

You can view the exact version of the check as it existed at that point in time by clicking the **check icon** on the right side of the activity entry.

![check-version](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/check-version-light.png)

A right side panel will open with the historical configuration of the check.
