# Checks in Datastore

Checks are validation rules applied to datasets to ensure data quality and integrity. They can be categorized as Active, Draft, or Archived based on their status and usage. Each check includes detailed metadata such as importance, scan history, anomalies, and assertion results. This section guides you through viewing, managing, and analyzing these checks within your datastore.

Let's get started 🚀

## Navigation

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your checks.

![datastore](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/datastore-light-1.png#only-light)
![datastore](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/datastore-dark-1.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **"Checks"** from the Navigation Tab.

![checks](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/checks-dark-2.png#only-dark)

## Categories Checks

You can categorize your checks based on their status, such as Active, Draft, Archived (Invalid and Discarded), or All, according to your preference. This categorization offers a clear view of the data quality validation process, helping you manage checks efficiently and maintain data integrity.

### All 

By selecting **All Checks**, you can view a comprehensive list of all the checks in the datastore, including both **active** and **draft** checks, allowing you to focus on the checks that are currently being managed or are in progress. However, archived checks are not displayed in this.  

![all](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/all-light-3.png#only-light)
![all](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/all-dark-3.png#only-dark)

### Active

By selecting **Active**, you can view checks that are currently applied and being enforced on the data. These operational checks are used to validate data quality in real time, allowing you to monitor all active checks and their performance.

![active](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/active-light-4.png#only-light)
![active](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/active-dark-4.png#only-dark)

You can also categorize the active checks based on their importance and favorites to streamline your data quality monitoring.

**1. Important:** Shows only checks that are marked as important. These checks are prioritized based on their significance, typically assigned a weight of 7 or higher.

!!! note 
    Important checks are prioritized based on a weight of 7 or higher.

![important](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/important-light-5.png#only-light)

### Draft Checks

By selecting **Draft**, you can view checks that have been created but have not yet been applied to the data. These checks are in the drafting stage, allowing for adjustments and reviews before activation. Draft checks provide flexibility to experiment with different validation rules without affecting the actual data.

![draft](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/draft-light-9.png#only-light)
![draft](../assets/datastore-checks/checks-datastore/draft-dark-9.png#only-dark)

Once a timeframe is selected, the Assertion Over Time chart below will automatically adjust to reflect assertion activity within the chosen window.

### Properties Section

The Properties section explains where this check is applied. In this case, the check is applied to a table called **supplier**, specifically to the **s_comment** field of type **String**. There is no filter added, so the check is applied to all rows in the table. This helps maintain clean and trustworthy data, especially when phone numbers must be unique per customer.
