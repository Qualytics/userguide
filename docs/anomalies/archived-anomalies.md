# Archive Anomlies

Archiving anomalies helps you manage your active anomaly list by moving reviewed or non-critical records into an inactive state without deleting them. Whether marked as resolved, duplicate, or invalid, archived anomalies remain accessible for future reference or audit purposes. This action ensures your workspace stays focused while preserving historical insights for better data quality tracking.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Archive Specific Anomalies

You can archive individual anomalies either directly or through the action menu.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-light-1.png#only-light)
![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-dark-1.png#only-dark)

**Step 2**: Click on the **‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/anomalies-light-2.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/anomalies-dark-2.png#only-dark)

### 1. Archive Directly

**Step 1:** Locate the anomaly (whether Active or Acknowledged) you want to archive.

![archived-directly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archived-directly-light-25.png#only-light)
![archived-directly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archived-directly-dark-25.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **vertical ellipsis (‚ãÆ)** located on the right side of the anomaly and select **‚ÄúArchive‚Äù** from the drop down menu.

![archive-option](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-option-light.png#only-light)
![archive-option](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-option-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3:** A modal window titled **‚ÄúArchive Anomaly‚Äù** will appear, providing you with the following archive options:

* **Resolved**: Choose this option if the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed. This helps maintain a record of resolved issues while ensuring that they are no longer active.  
* **Duplicate**: Choose this option if the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed. No further action is required as the issue has been previously resolved.  
* **Invalid**: Select this option if the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action. Archiving anomalies as invalid helps differentiate between real issues and those that can be dismissed, improving overall data quality management.

![archive-anomaly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-anomaly-dark-26.png#only-dark)

**Step 4:** Once you've made your selection, click the **Archive** button to proceed.

### 2. Archive via Action Menu

**Step 1**: Click on the anomaly from the list of available (whether Active or Acknowledged) anomalies that you want to archive.

![archive-action](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-action-light-29.png#only-light)
![archive-action](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-action-dark-29.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** You will be directed to the anomaly details page. Click on the **Settings** icon located at the top right corner of the interface and select **‚ÄúArchive‚Äù** from the drop down menu.

**Step 3:** A modal window titled **‚ÄúArchive Anomaly‚Äù** will appear, providing you with the following archive options:

* **Resolved**: Choose this option if the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed. This helps maintain a record of resolved issues while ensuring that they are no longer active.  
* **Duplicate**: Choose this option if the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed. No further action is required as the issue has been previously resolved.  
* **Invalid**: Select this option if the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action. Archiving anomalies as invalid helps differentiate between real issues and those that can be dismissed, improving overall data quality management.

## Archive Anomalies in Bulk

To handle multiple anomalies efficiently, you can archive them in bulk, allowing you to quickly move large volumes of anomalies into the archived state.

**Step 1:** Hover over the anomaly (whether Active or Acknowledged) and click on the checkbox to select multiple anomalies.

![archive-bulk](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-bulk-light-34.png#only-light)
![archive-bulk](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archive-bulk-dark-34.png#only-dark)

When multiple anomalies are selected, an action toolbar appears, displaying the total number of selected anomalies along with a vertical ellipsis for additional bulk action options.

## Archive Anomalies using Dialogue

You can archive anomalies using dialogue from the Explore page detected across multiple datastores in a centralized view. This method is ideal for reviewing and archiving issues without navigating into individual datastore pages.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **Explore** button on the left side panel of the interface.

![explore](../assets/explore/anomalies/explore-light.png#only-light)

**Step 2:** Click on the **"Anomalies"** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-light.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-dark.png#only-dark)

You will be navigated to the **Anomalies** tab, where you'll see a list of all the detected anomalies across various tables and fields from different source datastores, based on the applied data quality checks.

![all](../assets/explore/anomalies/all-anomalies-light.png#only-light)
