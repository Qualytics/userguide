# Anomalies in Datastore

Anomalies in Qualytics are indicators of data that deviate from expected patterns or defined quality rules, often pointing to inconsistencies, errors, or unusual behavior within your datasets. These anomalies can arise when records or columns fail to meet validation checks‚Äîwhether those checks are inferred by the system or authored manually by users.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Navigation

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

![datastore](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/datastore-light-1.png#only-light)
![datastore](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/datastore-dark-1.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/anomalies-light-2.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/anomalies-dark-2.png#only-dark)

## Anomaly Status Categories

Anomalies exist in one of five distinct statuses, which are grouped into two broad categories:

### Open Anomalies

By selecting Open Anomalies, you can view anomalies that have been detected but remain unacknowledged or unresolved. These anomalies require attention and may need further investigation or corrective action.

![open-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/open-anomalies-light-2.png#only-light)
![open-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/open-anomalies-dark-2.png#only-dark)

This option helps focus on unaddressed issues while allowing seamless navigation to **All**, **Active**, or **Acknowledged** anomalies as needed.

**1. Active**: By selecting **Active Anomalies**, you can focus on anomalies that are currently unresolved or require immediate attention. These are the anomalies that are still in play and have not yet been acknowledged, archived, or resolved.

![active-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/active-anomalies-light-4.png#only-light)
![active-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/active-anomalies-dark-4.png#only-dark)

**2. Acknowledged**: By selecting **Acknowledged Anomalies**, you can see all anomalies that have been reviewed and marked as acknowledged. This status indicates that the anomalies have been noted, though they may still require further action.

![acknowledged-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/acknowledged-anomalies-light-5.png#only-light)
![acknowledged-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/acknowledged-anomalies-dark-5.png#only-dark)

**3. All**: By selecting **All Anomalies**, you can view the complete list of anomalies, regardless of their status. This option helps you get a comprehensive overview of all issues that have been detected, whether they are currently active, acknowledged, or archived.

![all-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/all-anomalies-light-3.png#only-light)
![all-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/all-anomalies-dark-3.png#only-dark)

### Archived Anomalies

By selecting **Archived Anomalies**, you can view anomalies that have been resolved or moved out of active consideration. Archiving anomalies allows you to keep a record of past issues without cluttering the active list.

![archived-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/archived-anomalies-light-6.png#only-light)
![archived-anomalies](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/archived-anomalies-dark-6.png#only-dark)

You can also categorize the archived anomalies based on their status as **Resolved**, **Duplicate** and **Invalid**, to manage and review them effectively.

**1. Resolved**: This indicates that the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed.

![resolved](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/resolved-light-7.png#only-light)
![resolved](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/resolved-dark-7.png#only-dark)

**2. Duplicate**: This indicates that the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed.

![duplicate](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/duplicate-light.png#only-light)
![duplicate](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/duplicate-dark.png#only-dark)

**3. Invalid**: This indicates that the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action.

![invalid](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/invalid-light-8.png#only-light)
![invalid](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/invalid-dark-8.png#only-dark)

**4. All**: Displays all archived anomalies, including those marked as Resolved, Duplicate, and Invalid, giving a comprehensive view of all past issues. 

![all](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/all-light-9.png#only-light)
![all](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/all-dark-9.png#only-dark)

## Anomaly Details

Anomaly Details View provides key insights into a specific data anomaly, including its status, anomalous record count, failed checks, and weight. It also shows when the anomaly was detected, the triggering scan, and the related datastore, table, and location.

| No. | Field | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Check ID & Name** | This is the name and unique number of the check. It‚Äôs checking if dates fall within a specific range. |
| **2** | **Description** | Tells you what this check is doing. Here it is making sure values are between a minimum and maximum time. |
| **3** | **Tags** | Shows how important this issue is. In this case, it's marked as **High** priority. |
| **4** | **Table** | The name of the dataset or table where this issue was found. |
| **5** | **Field** | The specific column being checked. Here it is LAST_UPDATED_DATE. |
| **6** | **Filter Clause** | Lets you narrow down the data being checked. No filter is applied here. |
| **7** | **Min** | The earliest allowed date/time value. Anything before this is marked as failed. |
| **8** | **Max** | The latest allowed date/time value. Anything after this is marked as failed. |
| **9** | **Coverage** | Defines how many records must meet the condition. A 100% coverage means all records must comply with this check. |

#### Filter by Anomalous Fields

The **Filter by anomalous fields** section enables users to refine failed checks by selecting specific fields where anomalies were detected, helping to focus the analysis on relevant data issues.

![filter](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/filter-light.png#only-light)
![filter](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/filter-dark.png#only-dark)

### Source Records

The **Source Records** section displays all the data and fields related to the detected anomaly from the dataset. It is an **Enrichment Datastore** that is used to store the analyzed results, including any anomalies and additional metadata in files, hence it is recommended to add/link an enrichment datastore with your connected source datastore.

![source-records-section](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/source-records-section-light.png#only-light)
![source-records-section](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/source-records-section-dark.png#only-dark)

!!! note 
    In anomaly detection, source records are displayed as part of the Anomaly Details. For a Record anomaly, the specific record is highlighted. For a Shape anomaly, 10 samples from the underlying anomalous records are highlighted.

#### Sort Options

The **Sort By** dropdown allows you to organize the failed source records based on the selected criteria.

![sort](../assets/datastores/anomalies-datastore/sort-light.png#only-light)

| No. | Sort By | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Name** | This is the name and unique number of the check. It‚Äôs checking if dates fall within a specific range. |
| **2** | **Weight** | Tells you what this check is doing. Here it is making sure values are between a minimum and maximum time. |
| **3** | **Quality Score** | Shows how important this issue is. In this case, it's marked as **High** priority. |
