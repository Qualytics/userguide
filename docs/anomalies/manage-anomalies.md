# Manage Anomalies

You can manage anomalies to ensure your data remains accurate and any quality issues are addressed efficiently. Anomalies, which occur due to errors or inconsistencies in data, can be categorized as **Open** or **Archived**, helping you track their status and take the appropriate actions. You can acknowledge anomalies that have been reviewed, archive those that no longer need attention, and delete any that are irrelevant or logged by mistake. 

Bulk actions further simplify the process, allowing you to manage multiple anomalies at once, saving time and effort. This guide will walk you through the steps of acknowledging, archiving, restoring, editing, and deleting anomalies, whether individually or in bulk.

Let's get started üöÄ

## Navigation

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-light-1.png#only-light)
![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-dark-1.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/anomalies-light-2.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/anomalies-dark-2.png#only-dark)

## Categories Anomalies

Anomalies can be classified into different categories based on their status and actions taken. These categories include Open and Archived anomalies. Managing anomalies effectively helps in maintaining data integrity and ensuring quick response to issues.

### Open

By selecting Open Anomalies, you can view anomalies that have been detected but remain unacknowledged or unresolved. These anomalies require attention and may need further investigation or corrective action. 

![open-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/open-anomalies-light-2.png#only-light)
![open-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/open-anomalies-dark-2.png#only-dark)

This option helps focus on unaddressed issues while allowing seamless navigation to **All**, **Active**, or **Acknowledged** anomalies as needed.

**1. Active**: By selecting **Active Anomalies**, you can focus on anomalies that are currently unresolved or require immediate attention. These are the anomalies that are still in play and have not yet been acknowledged, archived, or resolved.

![active-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/active-anomalies-light-4.png#only-light)
![active-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/active-anomalies-dark-4.png#only-dark)

**2. Acknowledged**: By selecting **Acknowledged Anomalies**, you can see all anomalies that have been reviewed and marked as acknowledged. This status indicates that the anomalies have been noted, though they may still require further action.

![acknowledged-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledged-anomalies-light-5.png#only-light)
![acknowledged-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledged-anomalies-dark-5.png#only-dark)

**3. All**: By selecting **All Anomalies**, you can view the complete list of anomalies, regardless of their status. This option helps you get a comprehensive overview of all issues that have been detected, whether they are currently active, acknowledged, or archived.

![all-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/all-anomalies-light-3.png#only-light)
![all-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/all-anomalies-dark-3.png#only-dark)

### Archived

By selecting **Archived Anomalies**, you can view anomalies that have been resolved or moved out of active consideration. Archiving anomalies allows you to keep a record of past issues without cluttering the active list.

![archived-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archived-anomalies-light-6.png#only-light)
![archived-anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/archived-anomalies-dark-6.png#only-dark)

You can also categorize the archived anomalies based on their status as **Resolved**, **Duplicate** and **Invalid**, to manage and review them effectively.

**1. Resolved**: This indicates that the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed.

![resolved](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/resolved-light-7.png#only-light)
![resolved](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/resolved-dark-7.png#only-dark)

**2. Duplicate**: This indicates that the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed.

![duplicate](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/duplicate-light.png#only-light)
![duplicate](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/duplicate-dark.png#only-dark)

**3. Invalid**: This indicates that the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action.

![invalid](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/invalid-light-8.png#only-light)
![invalid](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/invalid-dark-8.png#only-dark)

**4. All**: Displays all archived anomalies, including those marked as Resolved, Duplicate, and Invalid, giving a comprehensive view of all past issues. 

![all](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/all-light-9.png#only-light)
![all](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/all-dark-9.png#only-dark)

## Acknowledge Anomalies

By acknowledging anomalies, you indicate that they have been reviewed or recognized. This can be done either individually or in bulk, depending on your workflow. Acknowledging anomalies helps you keep track of issues that have been addressed, even if further action is still required.

!!! warning 
    Once an anomaly is acknowledged, it remains acknowledged and never reverts to the active state.

### Method I. Acknowledge Specific Anomaly

You can acknowledge individual anomalies either directly or through the action menu, giving you precise control over each anomaly's status.

#### 1. Acknowledge Directly

**Step 1:** Locate the active anomaly you want to acknowledge, and click on the acknowledge icon (represented by an **eye** icon) located on the right side of the anomaly.

## Filter and Sort
Filter and Sort options allow you to organize your anomaly by various criteria, such as Weight, Anomalous Record, Created Date. You can also apply filters to refine your list of anomaly based on Timeframe, Type and Rule etc.

### Sort

You can sort your anomalies by **Anomalous Record**, **Created Date**, and **Weight** to easily organize and prioritize them according to your needs.

![sort](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/sort-light.png#only-light)
![sort](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/sort-dark.png#only-dark)

| No | Sort By Option | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Anomalous Record** | Sorts anomalies based on the number of anomalous records identified. |
| **2** | **Created Date** | Sorts anomalies according to the date they were detected. |
| **3** | **Weight** | Sort anomalies by their assigned weight or importance level. |

Whatever sorting option is selected, you can arrange the data either in ascending or descending order by clicking the caret button next to the selected sorting criteria.
