# Anomalies

Anomalies in Qualytics represent data points that deviate from expected patterns or violate defined quality rules, often highlighting issues such as missing values, structural inconsistencies, or incorrect data. These anomalies are detected during scan operations through system-inferred or user-authored checks. Users can access anomalies in two ways, by navigating through a specific datastore to review source-specific issues, or via the Explore page to get a centralized view of all anomalies across datastores.

* [Datastore Anomaly](#datastore-anomaly)

* [Explore Anomaly](#explore-anomaly)

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Datastore Anomaly

Datastore anomalies are scoped to a specific data source, allowing users to investigate and address data quality issues within that particular datastore. This view offers contextual insights‚Äîsuch as affected tables, checks, and records‚Äîenabling precise root cause analysis and resolution at the source level.

### Navigation To Datastores

Accessing anomalies through a specific datastore lets you focus on data quality issues within that individual source. This view offers a detailed, contextual look at anomalies tied to a particular datastore, making it easier to drill down into affected tables and address issues at the source level.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-light-1.png#only-light)
![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-dark-1.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù** from the Navigation Tab.

### Anomaly Review

Anomaly Review provides key insights into a specific data anomaly, including its status, anomalous record count, failed checks, and weight. It also shows when the anomaly was detected, the triggering scan, and the related datastore, table, and location. This view helps users quickly understand the scope and source of the anomaly for easier investigation and resolution.

**Step 1:** Click on the anomaly that you want to see the details of.

#### Summary Section

The **Summary** section provides a quick overview of the anomaly's key attributes. It includes the anomaly‚Äôs status, total anomalous records, failed checks, weight, detection time, scan information, and the corresponding datastore and table. This section helps users quickly understand where the anomaly occurred and its potential impact.

## Explore Anomaly

Explore anomalies offer a unified, cross-datastore view of all anomalies detected across your environment. This centralized view is ideal for monitoring overall data quality, managing large volumes of anomalies efficiently, and taking bulk actions without needing to navigate into each datastore individually.

### Navigation To Explore

The Explore view provides a centralized list of all anomalies detected across multiple datastores. This is useful for getting a global view of data issues and managing them in bulk without switching between individual datastores.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **Explore** button on the left side panel of the interface.

![explore](../assets/explore/anomalies/explore-light.png#only-light)
![explore](../assets/explore/anomalies/explore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **"Anomalies"** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-light.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-dark.png#only-dark)

You will be navigated to the **Anomalies** tab, where you'll see a list of all the detected anomalies across various tables and fields from different source datastores, based on the applied data quality checks.

### Anomaly Details

**Anomaly Details** window provides information about anomalies identified during scan operations. It displays details such as the anomaly ID, status, type, detection time, and where it is in the data, such as the datastore and table.  Additionally, it offers options to explore datasets, share details, and collaborate, making it easier to resolve data issues.

**Step 1:** Click on the anomaly from the list of available (whether Active, Acknowledged or Archived) anomalies to view its details.
