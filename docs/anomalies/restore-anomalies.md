# Restore Anomalies

Restoring anomalies allows you to move archived anomalies back into the acknowledged state for further investigation or tracking. This is helpful when previously archived issues need to be revisited or reassessed. Restored anomalies do not return to the active state, but remain visible for continued analysis and review.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Restore Anomalies using Details

Restore archived anomalies from the datastore view to bring them back into the acknowledged state. This is useful when anomalies need to be re-evaluated within a specific source datastore.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

**Step 2:** Click on the **‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù** from the Navigation Tab.

**Step 3**: Click on the anomaly that you want to restore from the list of archived anomalies.

## Restore Anomalies using Dialogue

You can restore anomalies using dialogue from the Explore page across multiple datastores through a unified view. This allows you to quickly reinstate archived anomalies without drilling into individual datastores.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the **Explore** button on the left side panel of the interface.

![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-light.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-dark.png#only-dark)

You will be navigated to the **Anomalies** tab, where you'll see a list of all the detected anomalies across various tables and fields from different source datastores, based on the applied data quality checks.
