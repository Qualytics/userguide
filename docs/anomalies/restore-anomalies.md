# Restore Anomalies

By restoring archived anomalies, you can bring them back into the **acknowledged** state for further investigation or review. These anomalies will not return to the **active** state once they have been acknowledged.

**Step 1**: Click on the anomaly that you want to restore from the list of archived anomalies.
