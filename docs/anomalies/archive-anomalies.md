# Archive Anomalies

By archiving anomalies, you move them to an inactive state, while still keeping them available for future reference or analysis. Archiving helps keep your active anomaly list clean without permanently deleting the records.

## Archive Specific Anomalies

You can archive individual anomalies either directly or through the action menu.

### 1. Archive Directly

**Step 1:** Locate the anomaly (whether Active or Acknowledged) you want to archive.

**Step 2:** Click on the **vertical ellipsis (⋮)** located on the right side of the anomaly and select **“Archive”** from the drop down menu.

**Step 3:** A modal window titled **“Archive Anomaly”** will appear, providing you with the following archive options:

* **Resolved**: Choose this option if the anomaly was a legitimate data quality concern and has been addressed. This helps maintain a record of resolved issues while ensuring that they are no longer active.  
* **Duplicate**: Choose this option if the anomaly is a duplicate of an existing record and has already been addressed. No further action is required as the issue has been previously resolved.  
* **Invalid**: Select this option if the anomaly is not a legitimate data quality concern and does not require further action. Archiving anomalies as invalid helps differentiate between real issues and those that can be dismissed, improving overall data quality management.

## Archive Anomalies in Bulk

To handle multiple anomalies efficiently, you can archive them in bulk, allowing you to quickly move large volumes of anomalies into the archived state.

**Step 1:** Hover over the anomaly (whether Active or Acknowledged) and click on the checkbox to select multiple anomalies.
