# Acknowledge Anomalies

By acknowledging anomalies, you indicate that they have been reviewed or recognized. This can be done either individually or in bulk, depending on your workflow. Acknowledging anomalies helps you keep track of issues that have been addressed, even if further action is still required.

!!! warning
    Once an anomaly is acknowledged, it remains acknowledged and never reverts to the active state.

## Acknowledge Specific Anomaly

You can acknowledge individual anomalies either directly or through the action menu, giving you precise control over each anomaly's status.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

## Acknowledge Anomalies in Bulk

By acknowledging anomalies in bulk, you can quickly mark multiple anomalies as reviewed at once, saving time and ensuring that all relevant issues are addressed simultaneously.

**Step 1:** Hover over the active anomalies and click on the checkbox to select multiple anomalies.
