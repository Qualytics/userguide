# Acknowledge Anomalies 

Acknowledging anomalies helps you mark data issues that have been reviewed or recognized as valid concerns. This action allows you to track which anomalies have been addressed, even if further resolution is pending. You can acknowledge anomalies individually or in bulk, making it easier to manage large datasets. Once acknowledged, anomalies are no longer considered active and cannot revert to their previous state.

!!! warning
    Warning Once an anomaly is acknowledged, it remains acknowledged and never reverts to the active state.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Acknowledge Specific Anomaly

You can acknowledge individual anomalies either directly or through the action menu, giving you precise control over each anomaly's status.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu on which you want to manage your anomalies.

![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-light-1.png#only-light)
![datastore](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/datastore-dark-1.png#only-dark)

**Step 2**: Click on the **‚ÄúAnomalies‚Äù** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/anomalies-dark-2.png#only-dark)

### 1. Acknowledge Directly

**Step 1:** Locate the active anomaly you want to acknowledge.

![acknowledge-directly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-directly-light-10.png#only-light)
![acknowledge-directly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-directly-dark-10.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **vertical ellipsis (‚ãÆ)** located on the right side of the anomaly and select **‚ÄúAcknowledge‚Äù** from the drop down menu.

![acknowledge-option](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-option-light.png#only-light)
![acknowledge-option](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-option-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3:** After clicking on the **Acknowledge** button your anomaly is successfully moved to the acknowledged state and a flash message will appear saying **‚ÄúThe Anomaly has been successfully acknowledged‚Äù**.

![acknowledge-msg](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-msg-dark-13.png#only-dark)

### 2. Acknowledge via Action Menu

**Step 1**: Click on the active anomaly from the list of available anomalies that you want to acknowledge.

![active-anomaly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/active-anomaly-light-14.png#only-light)
![active-anomaly](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/active-anomaly-dark-14.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** You will be directed to the anomaly details page. Click on the **Acknowledge** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.

![vertical-acknowledge](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/vertical-acknowledge-light-15.png#only-light)
![vertical-acknowledge](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/vertical-acknowledge-dark-15.png#only-dark)

**Step 3:** After clicking on the **Acknowledge** button your anomaly is successfully moved to the acknowledged state and a flash message will appear saying **‚ÄúThe Anomaly has been successfully acknowledged‚Äù**.

![acknowledge-message](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-message-light-18.png#only-light)
![acknowledge-message](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-message-dark-18.png#only-dark)

## Acknowledge Anomalies in Bulk

By acknowledging anomalies in bulk, you can quickly mark multiple anomalies as reviewed at once, saving time and ensuring that all relevant issues are addressed simultaneously.

**Step 1:** Hover over the active anomalies and click on the checkbox to select multiple anomalies.

![acknowledge-bulk](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-bulk-light-19.png#only-light)
![acknowledge-bulk](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-bulk-dark-19.png#only-dark)

When multiple anomalies are selected, an action toolbar appears, displaying the total number of selected anomalies along with a vertical ellipsis for additional bulk action options.

![action-toolbar](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/action-toolbar-light-20.png#only-light)
![action-toolbar](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/action-toolbar-dark-20.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **vertical ellipsis (‚ãÆ)** and choose **"Acknowledge"** from the dropdown menu to acknowledge the selected anomalies.

![vertical-acknowledge](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/vertical-acknowledge-light-21.png#only-light)
![vertical-acknowledge](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/vertical-acknowledge-dark-21.png#only-dark)

A modal window titled **‚ÄúAcknowledge Anomalies‚Äù** will appear, confirming that this action acknowledges the anomalies as a legitimate data quality concern.

You also have the option to leave a comment in the provided field to provide additional context or details.

![acknowledge-button](../assets/datastores/manage-anomalies/acknowledge-button-dark-23.png#only-dark)

**Step 4:** After clicking on the **Acknowledge** button your anomalies are successfully moved to the acknowledged state and a flash message will appear saying **‚ÄúThe Anomalies have been successfully acknowledged‚Äù.**

## Acknowledge Anomalies using Dialogue

You can acknowledge anomalies using dialogue through the Explore page in Qualytics. It allows users to review and acknowledge anomalies from multiple datastores in a centralized interface, making it easier to manage and act on anomalies without navigating into individual datastores.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click the Explore button on the left side panel of the interface.

![explore](../assets/explore/anomalies/explore-light.png#only-light)
![explore](../assets/explore/anomalies/explore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** Click on the **"Anomalies"** from the Navigation Tab.

![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-light.png#only-light)
![anomalies](../assets/explore/anomalies/anomalies-dark.png#only-dark)

You will be navigated to the **Anomalies** tab, where you'll see a list of all the detected anomalies across various tables and fields from different source datastores, based on the applied data quality checks.

![all](../assets/explore/anomalies/all-anomalies-light.png#only-light)
![all](../assets/explore/anomalies/all-anomalies-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3**: Click on the active anomaly from the list of available anomalies that you want to acknowledge.

![ackno](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-light.png#only-light)
![ackno](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 4:** A modal window will appear displaying the anomaly details. Click on the **acknowledge (üëÅ)** icon located in the upper-right corner of the modal window.

![ackno-window](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-window-light.png#only-light)
![ackno-window](../assets/explore/anomalies/ackno-window-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 5:** After clicking on the **Acknowledge** icon your anomaly is successfully moved to the acknowledge and a flash message will appear saying ‚Äú**The Anomaly has been successfully acknowledged‚Äù.**

## FAQs

**Can I revert the Acknowledged Anomaly Status?**

No, once an anomaly is acknowledged, it cannot be reverted to the active state. The acknowledgment is permanent.
