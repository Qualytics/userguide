# Delete Anomalies

Deleting anomalies allows you to permanently remove entries that are no longer relevant, were resolved, or were captured in error. This ensures your anomaly list remains clean, focused, and easy to manage. Whether you're addressing a few outdated records or performing a bulk cleanup, deleting anomalies helps maintain clarity and accuracy in your data quality monitoring process. Only archived anomalies can be deleted to preserve the integrity of active investigations.

!!! note
    You can only delete archived anomalies, not active or acknowledged anomalies. If you want to delete an active or acknowledged anomaly, you must first move it to the archive, and then you can delete it.

!!! warning
    Deleting an anomaly is a one-time action. It cannot be restored after deletion.
