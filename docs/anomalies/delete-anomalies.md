# Delete Anomalies

Deleting anomalies allows you to permanently remove records that are no longer relevant or were logged in error. This can be done individually or for multiple anomalies at once, ensuring that your anomaly records remain clean and up to date.

!!! note
    You can only delete archived anomalies, not active or acknowledged anomalies. If you want to delete an active or acknowledged anomaly, you must first move it to the archive, and then you can delete it. 

!!! warning
    Deleting an anomaly is a one-time action. It cannot be restored after deletion.

## Delete Specific Anomaly

You can delete individual anomalies using one of two methods:

#### 1. Delete Directly
