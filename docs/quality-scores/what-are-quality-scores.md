# Quality Scores

Quality Scores are quantified measures of data quality calculated at the field
and [container](/userguide/glossary#container) levels, recorded as time-series to enable tracking of changes over time.
Scores range from 0-100, with higher values indicating superior quality. These scores integrate eight distinct factors,
providing a granular analysis of the attributes that impact the overall data quality.

## Quality Scoring a Field

Each field receives a total quality score based on eight key factors, each evaluated on a 0-100 scale. The overall score
is a composite, reflecting the relative importance and configured weights of these factors:

- **Completeness**: Measures the average completeness of a field across all profiles.
- **Coverage**: Assesses the adequacy of data quality checks for the field.
- **Conformity**: Checks alignment with standards defined by quality checks.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity in type and scale across all data representations.
- **Precision**: Evaluates the resolution of field values against defined quality checks.
- **Timeliness**: Gauges data availability according to schedule, inheriting the container's timeliness.
- **Volumetrics**: Analyzes consistency in data size and shape over time, inheriting the container's volumetrics.
- **Accuracy**: Determines the fidelity of field values to their real-world counterparts.

## Quality Scoring a Container

A container is any structured data entity, such as a table or dataframe, that comprises multiple fields. Containers are
scored using the same eight factors, with each factor's score derived from a weighted average across its fields.
Additional container-specific metrics also influence the total quality score:

- **Shape anomaly adjustments**
- **Volumetric checks**
- **Scanning frequency**
- **Profiling frequency**
- **Timeliness assessments through Freshness SLA**
- **Impact of Freshness SLA violations**

## Customizing Quality Score Weights and Decay Time

You can tailor the impact of each quality factor on the total score by adjusting their weights, allowing the scoring
system to align with your organizationâ€™s data governance priorities. Additionally, the decay period for considering past
data events defaults to 180 days but can be customized to fit your operational needs, ensuring the scores reflect the
most relevant data quality insights.
