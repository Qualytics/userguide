# Inferred check

* Qualytics automatically generates and maintains `inferred` checks by Profiling the Datastore, performing statistical analysis followed by various machine learning methods. 

!!! info
     `Inferred checks` will be automatically updated with the next Profiling run.   
     `Manually` updating an inferred check will take it out of the automatic update workflow.

# Inference Engine

* After metadata is generated by a `Profile Operation`, Inference Engine is initiated to kick off  `Inductive` and `Unsupervised` learning methods 

* Available data is partitioned into a training set and a testing set.  

* The engine applies numerous machine learning models & techniques to the training data in an effort to discover well-fitting data quality constraints. 

* Those inferred constraints are then filtered by testing them against the held out testing set & only those that assert true above a certain threshold are converted and exposed to users as `Inferred Checks`.
