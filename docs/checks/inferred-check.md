# Inferred Check

Qualytics automatically generates inferred checks during a Profile operation. These checks typically cover 80-90% of the rules needed by users. They are created and maintained through profiling, which involves statistical analysis and machine learning methods.

Let's get started ðŸš€

## Navigation

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and select the datastore from the left menu.

**Step 2:** Click on the "Checks" from the Navigation Tab.

**Step 3:** In the top-right corner, click on the "**Run**" button, then select "**Profile**" from the dropdown menu.This action will initiate the profiling process that generates inferred checks.

!!! note 
    Inferred checks will be automatically updated with the next Profiling run. Manually updating an inferred check will take it out of the automatic update workflow. 

To understand how to Inferred checks, you can follow the remaining steps from the documentation [**Profile Operation.**](../source-datastore/profile.md)

After the profiling run is complete, inferred checks will be automatically created based on the analysis of your data.

## Inference Engine

1. After metadata is generated by a [**Profile Operation**](../source-datastore/profile.md), Inference Engine is initiated to kick off Inductive and Unsupervised learning methods.  
     
2. Available data is partitioned into a training set and a testing set.  
     
3. The engine applies numerous machine learning models & techniques to the training data in an effort to discover well-fitting data quality constraints.

4. Those inferred constraints are then filtered by testing them against the held out testing set & only those that assert true above a certain threshold are converted and exposed to users as Inferred Checks.
