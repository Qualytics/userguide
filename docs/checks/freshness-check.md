# Freshness Check

A Freshness Check ensures data stays up-to-date by monitoring its last update time. It prevents stale data from impacting reports and dashboards while detecting outdated information early. By setting a maximum age threshold, it helps identify pipeline failures and ensures accurate, real-time analytics for reliable business insights.

Let's get started üöÄ

## Importance of Freshness Check

A Freshness Check ensures data is always up-to-date for real-time analytics. It prevents stale data from affecting reports and dashboards while detecting pipeline failures early.

* Keeps data up-to-date for real-time analytics.

* Prevents stale data from affecting reports and dashboards.

* Detects data pipeline failures early.

## How It Works

A **Freshness Check** monitors when a dataset (table, file, or view) was last updated. If the data is **older than the allowed limit**, the system **triggers an alert**.

### Process Flow 

1. **Data Update:** System records the last update timestamp.

2. **Threshold Definition:** A **Maximum Age** (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours) is set.

3. **Scan:** The system checks if the data is within the allowed time.

4. **Result Evaluation:**

   * **Pass** ‚Üí Data is updated within the allowed time.

   * **Fail** ‚Üí Data is older than the limit, triggering an **alert**.

| 2. |            Table | Select the table for the rule to apply. |
| 3. |            Unit | Select time unit (**Hours, Minutes, Days**) for freshness measurement. |
| 4. |       Maximum Age | Set the time limit for data freshness. If exceeded, the check fails. |
| 5. |        Description | Enter a description for the check. |

**Step 5:** After completing all the check details, click on the "Validate" button. This will perform a validation operation on the check without saving it. The validation allows you to verify that the logic and parameters defined for the check are correct. It ensures that the check will work as expected by running it against the data without committing any changes.

## Example 

A company needs **hourly updates** on sales data to ensure real-time reports. A **Freshness Check** is set up with a **1-hour threshold**.

### Before Running the Check (Data is Fresh)

| No. | Order ID | Customer | Amount ($) | Last Updated |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 01 |             12345 |   John Doe |      49.99 |    10:30 AM |
| 02 |             12346 |   Jane Smith |      89.50 |    10:35 AM |

* **Current Time:** **`11:00 AM`**

* **Threshold:** **1 Hour**

* **Pass (Data is fresh)**

### When Freshness Check Fails (Data is Stale)

| No. |    Order ID |    Customer |   Amount($) |  Last Updated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 01 |    12345 |    John Doe |   49.99 |  09:30 AM |
| 02 |    12346 |    Jane Smith |   89.50 |  09:35 AM |
