# What is Infered Check?

* As Data Quality Checks are inferred from subsequent `Profile Operations`, those `Checks` must be reconciled with any existing inferred or human authored Checks. 

!!! info
     `Inferred checks` will be automatically updated with the next Profiling run.   
     `Manually` updating an inferred check will take it out of the automatic update workflow.

# Inference Engine

* After Firewall gathers all the metadata generated by a profiling operation, it feeds that metadata into our Inference Engine.

* The inference engine then initiates a `“true machine learning”` (specifically, this is referred to as Inductive Learning) process whereby the available customer data is partitioned into a training set and a testing set.  

* The engine applies numerous machine learning models & techniques to the training data in an effort to discover well-fitting data quality constraints. 

* Those inferred constraints are then filtered by testing them against the held out testing set & only those that assert true are converted to inferred data quality Checks.
