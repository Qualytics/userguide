# Overview of a check

---
A `Check` is an encapsulation of a data quality rule along with additional context such as associated `notifications`, `tags`, `filters` and `tolerances`.

There are two types of Checks in Qualytics: `inferred` and `authored`:

* `Inferred` checks are automatically generated by the Qualytics platform as part of a `Profile Operation`. Typically, inferred checks will cover 80 - 90% of rules that a user would need.
* `Authored` checks are manually authored by a user via UI or API. There are many types of checks that can be authored through templates for common checks as well as more complex rules through SQL and UDF (in Scala).

*   `Any Not Null`: Asserts that one of the fields must not be null.

*   `Before DateTime`: Asserts that the field is a timestamp earlier than a specific date and time.

*   `Between`: Asserts that values are equal to or between two numbers.

*   `Between Times`: Asserts that values are equal to or between two dates or times.

*   `Distinct Count`: Asserts on the approximate count distinct of the given column.

*   `Equal To Field`: Asserts that this field is equal to another field.

*   `Exists in`: Asserts if the rows of a compared table/field of a specific Datastore exists in the selected table/field.

*   `Field Count`: Asserts that there must be exactly a specified number of fields.

*   `Greater Than`: Asserts that the field is a number greater than (or equal to) a value.

*   `Greater Than Field`: Asserts that this field is greater than another field.

*   `Is Credit Card`: Asserts that the values are credit card numbers.

*   `Is Not Replica Of`: Asserts that the dataset created by the targeted field(s) is not replicated by the referred field(s).

*   `Is Replica Of`: Asserts that the dataset created by the targeted field(s) is replicated by the referred field(s).

*   `Less Than`: Asserts that the field is a number less than (or equal to) a value.

*   `Less Than Field`: Asserts that this field is less than another field.

*   `Max Length`: Asserts that a string has a maximum length.

*   `Max Value`: Asserts that a field has a maximum value.

*   `Metric`: Records the value of the selected field during each scan operation and asserts that the value is within a specified range (inclusive).

*   `Not Future`: Asserts that the field's value is not in the future.

*   `Not Negative`: Asserts that this is a non-negative number.

*   `Not Null`: Asserts that the field's value is not explicitly set to nothing.

*   `Positive`: Asserts that this is a positive number.

*   `Predicted By`: Asserts that the actual value of a field falls within an expected predicted range.

*   `Required Fields`: Asserts that all of the selected fields must be present in the datastore.

*   `Required Values`: Asserts that all of the defined values must be present at least once within a field.

*   `Satisfies Expression`: Evaluates the given expression (any valid `Spark SQL`) for each record.
