# Catalog Operation

A Catalog Operation imports named data collections like tables, views, and files into a Source Datastore. It identifies incremental fields for incremental scans, and offers options to recreate or delete these containers, streamlining data management and enhancing data discovery.

Let's get started üöÄ

## Key Components

### Incremental Identifier

An [incremental identifier](https://userguide.qualytics.io/glossary/#incremental-identifier) is essential for supporting incremental scan operations, as it allows the system to detect changes since the last operation.

### Partition Identifier

For large data containers or partitions, a [partition identifier](https://userguide.qualytics.io/glossary/#partition-identifier) is necessary to process data efficiently. In DFS datastores, the default fields for both incremental and partition identifiers are set by the last-modified timestamp. If a partition identifier is missing, the system uses repeatable ordering candidates (order-by fields) to process containers, although this method is less efficient for handling large datasets with many rows.

Attribute Overrides: After the profile operation, the qualytics engine might automatically update the containers to have partition fields and incremental fields. Those "attributes" can be manually overridden.

!!! note
    Advanced users should be able to override these auto-detected selections and overwritten options should persist through subsequent Catalog Operations.

## Initialization & Operation Options

### Automatic Catalog Operation

While adding the datastore, tick the Initiate Cataloging checkbox to automatically perform catalog operation on the configured source datastore.

![test-connection](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/test-connection-dark.png#only-dark)


With the automatic cataloging option turned on, you will be redirected to the datastore details page once the datastore (whether JDBC or DFS) is successfully added. You will observe the cataloging operation running automatically with the following default options:

-   Prune: Disabled ‚ùå  

-   Recreate: Disabled ‚ùå  

-   Include: Tables and views ‚úîÔ∏è

![catalog-start](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/catalog-start-dark.png#only-dark)

### Manual Catalog Operation

If automatic cataloging is disabled while adding the datastore, users can initiate the catalog operation manually by selecting preferred options. Manual catalog operation offers the users the flexibility to set up custom catalog configurations like syncing only tables or views.

**Step 1**: Select a source datastore from the side menu on which you would like to perform the catalog operation.

![add-source-datadtore](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/add-source-datadtore-light.png#only-light)
![add-source-datadtore](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/add-source-datadtore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2**: Clicking on your preferred datastore will navigate you to the datastore details page. Within the overview tab (default view), click on the Run button under Catalog to initiate the catalog operation.

![run-catalog](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/run-catalog-light.png#only-light)
![run-catalog](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/run-catalog-dark.png#only-dark)

A modal window will display **Operation Triggered** and you will be notified once the catalog operation is completed.  

!!! note
    You will receive a notification when the catalog operation is completed.

![opertaion-triggered](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/opertaion-triggered-light.png#only-light)
![opertaion-triggered](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/opertaion-triggered-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3**: Close the **Success** modal window and you will observe in the UI that the Catalog operation has been completed and it has gathered the data structures, file patterns, and corresponding metadata from your configured datastore.

#### Custom Catalog Configuration

The catalog operation can be custom-configured with the following options:  

-   **Prune**: Remove any existing named collections that no longer appear in the datastore

-   **Recreate**: Restore any previously removed named collection that does currently appear in the database

-   **Include**: Include Tables and Views

**Step 1**: Click on the **Run** button from the datastore details page (top-right corner) and select **Catalog** from the dropdown list.

![select-catalog](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/select-catalog-light.png#only-light)
![select-catalog](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/select-catalog-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2**: When configuring the catalog operation settings, you have two options to tune:

-   **Prune**: This option allows the removal of any named collections (tables, views, files, etc.) that no longer exist in the datastore. This ensures that outdated or obsolete collections are not included in future operations, keeping the datastore clean and relevant.

-   **Recreate**: This option enables the recreation of any named collections that have been previously deleted in Qualytics. It is useful for restoring collections that may have been removed accidentally or need to be brought back for analysis.

![catalog-operation](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/catalog-operation-light.png#only-light)
![catalog-operation](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/catalog-operation-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 3**: The user can choose whether to include only tables, only views, or both in the catalog operation. This flexibility allows for more targeted metadata analysis based on the specific needs of the data management task.

![include](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/include-light.png#only-light)
![include](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/include-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 4**: Click on the **Run Now** button to apply the updated operation settings and run the operation again.

## Operations Insights

When the catalog operation is completed, you will receive the notification and can navigate to the **Activity tab** for the datastore on which you triggered the Catalog Operation and learn about the operation results.

### Top Panel

**1. Runs (Default View)**: Provides insights into the operations that have been performed

**2. Schedule**: Provides insights into the [scheduled operations](https://userguide.qualytics.io/operation-automation/automated-tasks-with-cron/).

**3. Search**: Search any operation (including catalog) by entering the operation ID

**4. Sort by**: Organize the list of operations based on the **Created Date** or the **Duration**.

**5. Filter**: Narrow down the list of operations based on:

-   Operation Type

-   Operation Status

-   Table

## Post-Operation Details

### For JDBC Source Datastores

After the catalog operation is completed on a JDBC source datastore, users can view the following information:

**Container Names**: These are the names of the data collections (e.g., tables, views) identified during the catalog operation.

![container-names](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/container-names-light.png#only-light)
![container-names](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/container-names-dark.png#only-dark)

**Fields for Each Container**: Each container will display its fields or columns, which were detected during the catalog operation.

![connector-field](../assets/datastores/catalog-oprtations/connector-field-light.png#only-light)
![connector-field](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/connector-field-dark.png#only-dark)

**Incremental Identifiers and Partition Fields**: These settings are automatically configured based on the catalog operation. Incremental identifiers help in recognizing changes since the last scan, and partition fields aid in efficient data processing.

**Tree view > Container node > Gear icon > Settings option**

![table-settings](../assets/datastores/catalog-operations/table-settings-dark.png#only-dark)

### For DFS Source Datastores

After the catalog operation is completed on a DFS source datastore, users can view the following information:

-   **Container Names**: Similar to JDBC, these are the data collections identified during the catalog operation.

-   **Fields for Each Container**: Each container will list its fields or metadata detected during the catalog operation.

-   **Directory Tree Traversal**: The catalog operation traverses the directory tree, treating each file with a supported extension as a single-partition container. It reveals metadata such as the relative path, filename, and extension.

-  **Incremental Identifier and Partition Field**: By default, both the incremental identifier and partition field are set to the last-modified timestamp. This ensures efficient incremental scans and data partitioning.

-   **"Globbed" Containers**: Files in the same folder with the same extensions and similar naming formats are grouped into a single container, where each file is treated as a partition. This helps in managing and querying large datasets effectively.

## API Payload Examples
