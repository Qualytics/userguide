## Qualytics Supported roles

* The Qualytics Application supports 2 types of roles: `Admin` and `Member`.
    * While the `Admin` role has access to everything in the application and the ability to manage the `Users`, `Teams` and `Datastores`,
    * a `Member` can be assigned to `Read` or `Write` permission in a specific `Team`.
