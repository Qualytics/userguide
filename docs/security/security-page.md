## Qualytics Supported roles

* The Qualytics Application supports 2 types of roles: `Admin` and `Member`.
    * An `Admin` user has full access to everything in the system and can manage datastores, teams, and users. This means that an `Admin` has the ability to access everything in the application, as well as manage user accounts and team permissions.

    * On the other hand, a `Member` user has limited access to the system depending on the `Team` the user belongs to. 
    
## Qualytics Supported permissions

  * A team can have two types of permissions - `Read` and `Write`. 
  * A `Read` permission allows the user to only view the app and add/update comments 
  * while a `Write` permission allows the user to view and manage limited functionalities of the system.

## Security Page: Users, Teams and Datastores

As an `Admin` user, you can see the security page and navigate through the `Users`, `Teams` or `API Keys` tab:
