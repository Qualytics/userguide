# **Fuzzy Search for Forms & Filters**

You can now search with **typos** and **partial matches** across form and filter inputs, making it easier to find what you need with a more natural and forgiving search experience.  
This behavior applies to all areas of the platform where search or filter inputs are available ‚Äî such as **Checks**, **Profiles**, **Integrations**, and **Anomalies**.

Fuzzy Search enhances traditional filtering by allowing users to locate results **even when search terms are incomplete or slightly misspelled**.  
It helps speed up workflows when you can‚Äôt recall exact names, IDs, or field labels.

## üí° How It Works

- Works across both **form fields** and **filter dropdowns**.  
- Matches **partial text**, **case variations**, and **near-miss spellings**.  
- Applies instantly when typing in a text-based field or filter.  
- Compatible with multi-field and nested filter components.  

**Example:**  
Typing `afterda` automatically matches filters or fields containing **After Date Time**.

## Where It Applies

- **Filter Panels** ‚Üí Checks, Profiles, and Anomalies pages  
- **Searchable Dropdowns** ‚Üí Domain selection and configuration forms in Integrations  
- **Form Inputs** ‚Üí Fields that support text-based search from selectable lists  

!!! info
    This enhancement applies globally to all filter and form components that support search functionality.

## Notes

- Fuzzy search improves usability but does not override existing **validation** or **filter logic**.  
- Results are still scoped to the available data source ‚Äî matches must exist in the system.  
- You can continue to use **exact terms** for more precise searches.  

!!! warning
    If a selected value becomes unavailable (for example, when a domain is deleted or disabled), you‚Äôll see a **warning message** indicating the issue.  
    **Example:**  
    *‚ÄúThis domain (#402) is no longer available.‚Äù*  
    You can update or reselect a valid domain before saving your changes.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you‚Äôre filtering checks and can‚Äôt remember the full name of a rule.  
You type `afterda` in the **Rule** field, and the system instantly shows **After Date Time**, eliminating the need for exact matches.

!!! tip
    Use fuzzy search whenever you‚Äôre unsure of the exact keyword ‚Äî it‚Äôs especially helpful for long rule names, computed table fields, or descriptive labels.
