## Bulk Quality Check Creation via Templates
Spin up multiple checks from a single template and apply them across containers.

- Select multiple target containers in one go
- Reuse the same template configuration to keep checks consistent
- Great for onboarding new datasets quickly

## Pause & Resume Schedules
Temporarily stop a schedule and bring it back later — no reconfiguration needed.

- Deactivate / reactivate schedules without losing settings
- New filter option to **show only deactivated schedules**

## Test Connections Before Saving
Verify connection changes before you save them.

- Validate credentials, hosts, and permissions
- Catch issues early — avoid broken datastores after edits

## Data Preview Improvements
Data Preview now clearly indicates that **computed fields aren't supported in WHERE clauses** and hides them from autocomplete.
