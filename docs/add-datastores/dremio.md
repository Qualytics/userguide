# Dremio

Adding and configuring a Dremio connection within Qualytics empowers the platform to build a symbolic link with your schema to perform operations like data discovery, visualization, reporting, cataloging, profiling, scanning, anomaly surveillance, and more.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on adding Dremio as a source datastore in Qualytics. It covers the entire process, from initial connection setup to testing and finalizing the configuration.

By following these instructions, enterprises can ensure their Dremio environment is properly connected with Qualytics, unlocking the platformâ€™s potential to help you proactively manage your full data quality lifecycle.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Add the Source Datastore

A source datastore is a storage location used to connect to and access data from external sources. Dremio is an example of such a datastore, specifically a type of JDBC datastore that supports connectivity through the JDBC API. Configuring the Dremio datastore allows the Qualytics platform to access and perform operations on the data, thereby generating valuable insights.

**Step 1**: Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the **Add Source Datastore** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.

![add-source-datastore](../assets/datastores/dremio/add-source-datastore-light-1.png)

**Step 2**: A modal window - **Add Datastore** will appear, providing you with the options to connect a datastore.

![add-source-datastore](../assets/datastores/dremio/add-source-datastore-light-2.png)

| REF. | FIELDS | ACTIONS |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1. | Name | Specify the name of the datastore (e.g., the specified name will appear on the datastore cards) |
| 2. | Toggle Button | Toggle **ON** to create a new source datastore from scratch, or toggle **OFF** to reuse credentials from an existing connection |
| 3. | Connector | Select **Dremio** from the dropdown list. |

### Option I: Create a Datastore with a new Connection

If the toggle for **Add New connection** is turned on, then this will prompt you to add and configure the source datastore from scratch without using existing connection details.

**Step 1**: Select the **Dremio** connector from the dropdown list and add connection properties such as **Secrets Management**, host, port, username, and password, along with datastore properties like catalog, database, etc.

![add-source-datastore-details](../assets/datastores/dremio/add-source-datastore-details-light-3.png)

**Secrets Management:** This is an optional connection property that allows you to securely store and manage credentials by integrating with HashiCorp Vault and other secret management systems. Toggle it **ON** to enable Vault integration for managing secrets.

!!! note
    After configuring **HashiCorp Vault** integration, you can use ${key} in any Connection property to reference a key from the configured Vault secret. Each time the Connection is initiated, the corresponding secret value will be retrieved dynamically.

| REF. | FIELDS | ACTIONS |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1. | Login URL | Enter the URL used to authenticate with HashiCorp Vault. |
| 2. | Credentials Payload | Input a valid JSON containing credentials for Vault authentication. |
| 3. | Token JSONPath | Specify the JSONPath to retrieve the client authentication token from the response (e.g., $.auth.client_token). |
| 4. | Secret URL | Enter the URL where the secret is stored in Vault. |
| 5. | Token Header Name | Set the header name used for the authentication token (e.g., X-Vault-Token). |
| 6. | Data JSONPath | Specify the JSONPath to retrieve the secret data (e.g., $.data). |

| 2. | Port | Specify the **Port** number. |
| 3. | Project ID | Enter the Project ID associated with Dremio. |
| 4. | SSL Connection | Enable the SSL connection to ensure secure communication between Qualytics and the selected datastore. |
| 5. | Authentication | You can choose between Basic authentication or Access Token for validating and securing the connection to your Dremio instance. <br> <br>**Basic Authentication:** This method uses a username and password combination for authentication. It is a straightforward method where the user's credentials are directly used to access Dremio. <ul><li>**Type:** Select the authentication type from the dropdown menu.</li><li>**User:** Enter the username that Qualytics will use to connect to Dremio.</li><li>**Password:** Enter the password associated with the specified user account.</li></ul>**Access Token Authentication:** This method uses an access token for authentication. This is a more secure method compared to basic authentication.<ul><li> **Personal Access Token:** Enter the personal access token here to authenticate and access the resources securely.</li> </ul>|
| 6. | Schema | Define the schema within the database that should be used. |
| 7. | Teams | Select one or more teams from the dropdown to associate with this source datastore. |
| 8. | Initial Cataloging | Tick the checkbox to automatically perform a catalog operation on the configured source datastore to gather data structures and corresponding metadata. |

**Step 3**: After adding the source datastore details, click on the **Test Connection** button to check and verify its connection.

![test-source-connection](../assets/datastores/dremio/test-source-connection-light-5.png)

If the credentials and provided details are verified, a success message will be displayed indicating that the connection has been verified.

### Option II: Use an Existing Connection

If the toggle for **Add New connection** is turned off, then this will prompt you to configure the source datastore using the existing connection details.

**Step 1**: Select a **connection** to reuse existing credentials.

![add-datastore-details-existing](../assets/datastores/dremio/add-datastore-details-existing-light-6.png)

!!! note
    If you are using existing credentials, you can only edit the details such as **Schema**, **Teams** and **Initiate Cataloging**.

**Step 2**: Click on the **Test Connection** button to check and verify the source data connection. If the connection details are verified, a success message will be displayed.

![test-existing-enrichment-connection](../assets/datastores/dremio/test-existing-enrichment-connection-light-7.png)

!!! note
    Clicking on the **Finish** button will create the source datastore and bypass the **enrichment datastore** configuration step.

!!! tip
    Click on the **Next** button, which will take you to the **enrichment datastore** configuration page.

## Add Enrichment Datastore

After successfully testing and verifying your source datastore connection, you have the option to add an enrichment datastore (recommended). This datastore is used to store analyzed results, including any anomalies and additional metadata in tables. This setup provides comprehensive visibility into your data quality, enabling you to manage and improve it effectively.

!!! warning
    Qualytics does not support the Dremio connector as an enrichment datastore, but you can point to a different enrichment datastore.

**Step 1**: Whether you have added a source datastore by creating a new datastore connection or using an existing connection, click on the **Next** button to start adding the **Enrichment Datastore**.

![click-source](../assets/datastores/dremio/click-source-light-8.png)

**Step 2**: A modal window - **Link Enrichment Datastore** will appear, providing you with the options to configure an **enrichment datastore**.
