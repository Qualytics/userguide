# Snowflake

Adding and configuring a Snowflake connection within Qualytics empowers the platform to build a symbolic link with your schema to perform operations like data discovery, visualization, reporting, cataloging, profiling, scanning, anomaly surveillance, and more.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to add Snowflake as both a source and enrichment datastore in Qualytics. It covers the entire process, from initial connection setup to testing and finalizing the configuration.

By following these instructions, enterprises can ensure their Snowflake environment is properly connected with Qualytics, unlocking the platform's potential to help you proactively manage your full data quality lifecycle.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Snowflake Setup Guide

The Snowflake Setup Guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring warehouses and roles, ensuring efficient data management and access control. It explains how to create a warehouse with minimal requirements with the setup of a default warehouse for a user. It also explains how to create custom read-only and read-write roles and grant the necessary privileges for data access and modification. 

This guide is designed to help you optimize your Snowflake environment for performance and security, whether setting it up for the first time or refining your configuration.

### Warehouse & Role Configuration

This section provides instructions for configuring Snowflake warehouses and roles. It includes creating a warehouse with minimum requirements, assigning a default warehouse for a user, creating custom read-only and read-write roles, and granting privileges to these roles for data access and modification.

#### Create a Warehouse

Use the following command to create a warehouse with minimum requirements:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE qualytics_wh
WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
```

Set a specific warehouse as the default for a user:

```sql
ALTER USER <username> SET DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = qualytics_wh;
```

#### Source Datastore Privileges and Permissions

Create a new role called ```qualytics_read_role``` and grant it privileges:

```sql
CREATE ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE qualytics_wh TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <database_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <database_name>.<schema_name>.<table_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<schema_name> TO ROLE qualytics_read_role;
GRANT ROLE qualytics_read_role TO USER <user_name>;
```

#### Enrichment Datastore Privileges and Permissions

Create a new role called ```qualytics_readwrite_role``` and grant it privileges:

```sql
CREATE ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE qualytics_wh TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT USAGE, MODIFY ON DATABASE <database_name> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT USAGE, MODIFY ON SCHEMA <database_name>.<qualytics_schema> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT CREATE TABLE ON SCHEMA <database_name>.<qualytics_schema> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<qualytics_schema> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<qualytics_schema> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<qualytics_schema> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA <database_name>.<qualytics_schema> TO ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role;
GRANT ROLE qualytics_readwrite_role TO USER <user_name>;
```

## Add a Source Datastore

A source datastore is a storage location used to connect to and access data from external sources. Snowflake is an example of a source datastore, specifically a type of JDBC datastore that supports connectivity through the JDBC API. Configuring the JDBC datastore enables the Qualytics platform to access and perform operations on the data, thereby generating valuable insights.

**Step 1**: Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the **Add Source Datastore** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.

![add-datastore](../assets/datastores/snowflake/add-datastore-light.png#only-light)
![add-datastore](../assets/datastores/snowflake/add-datastore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2**: A modal window- **Add Datastore** will appear, providing you with the options to connect a datastore.

| 3Ô∏è.  | Connector (Required) | Select **Snowflake** from the dropdown list. |

### Option I: Create a Source Datastore with a New Connection

If the toggle for **Use an existing connection** is turned off, then this will prompt you to add and configure the source datastore from scratch without using existing connection details.

**Step 1**: Select the **Snowflake** connector from the dropdown list and add the connection details such as account, role, warehouse, user, and password.

![test-datastore-connection](../assets/datastores/snowflake/test-datastore-connection-dark.png#only-dark)

### Option II: Use an Existing Connection

If the toggle for **Use an existing connection** is turned on, then this will prompt you to configure the source datastore using existing connection details.

**Step 1**: Select a **connection** to reuse existing credentials.

!!!note
    If you are using existing credentials, you can only edit the details such as Database, Schema, Teams and Initiate Cataloging.

**Step 2**: Click on the **Test Connection**  button to check and verify the source data connection. If connection details are verified, a success message will be displayed.

![test-connection-for-existing-datastore](../assets/datastores/snowflake/test-connection-for-existing-datastore-dark.png#only-dark)

!!!note
    Clicking on the **Finish** button will create the source datastore and bypass the **enrichment datastore** configuration step.

!!!info
    It is recommended to click on the **Next** button, which will take you to the **enrichment datastore** configuration page.

## Add Enrichment Datastore Connection

Once you have successfully tested and verified your source datastore connection, you have the option to add the enrichment datastore **(recommended)**. The enrichment datastore is used to store the analyzed results, including any anomalies and additional metadata in tables. This setup provides full visibility into your data quality, helping you manage and improve it effectively.

**Step 1**: Whether you have added a source datastore by creating a new datastore connection or using an existing connection, click on the **Next** button to start adding the **Enrichment Datastore**.

**Step 2**: After selecting an existing **enrichment datastore** connection, you will view the following details related to the selected enrichment:

-  **Teams**: The team associated with managing the enrichment datastore. Example - All users are assigned to the **Public** team, which means that this enrichment datastore is accessible to all the users.

-   **Host**: This is the host domain of the Snowflake instance.

-   **Database**: Refers to the specific database within the Snowflake environment. This database is a logical grouping of schemas. Each database belongs to a single Snowflake account.

-   **Schema**: The schema used in the enrichment datastore. The schema is a logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, etc.). Each schema belongs to a single database.
