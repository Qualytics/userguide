# Presto

Adding and configuring a Presto connection within Qualytics empowers the platform to build a symbolic link with your schema to perform operations like data discovery, visualization, reporting, cataloging, profiling, scanning, anomaly surveillance, and more.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to add Presto as both a source and enrichment datastore in Qualytics. It covers the entire process, from initial connection setup to testing and finalizing the configuration.

By following these instructions, enterprises can ensure their Presto environment is properly connected with Qualytics, unlocking the platform's potential to help you proactively manage your full data quality lifecycle

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Add a Source Datastore

A source datastore is a storage location used to connect to and access data from external sources. Presto is an example of a source datastore, specifically a type of JDBC datastore that supports connectivity through the JDBC API. Configuring the JDBC datastore enables the Qualytics platform to access and perform operations on the data, thereby generating valuable insights.

**Step 1**: Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the **Add Source Datastore** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.

!!! note 
    Clicking on the Finish button will create the source datastore and bypass the enrichment datastore configuration step. 

!!! info 
    It is recommended to click on the Next button, which will take you to the enrichment datastore configuration page. 

## Add Enrichment Datastore

Once you have successfully tested and verified your source datastore connection, you have the option to add the enrichment datastore (recommended). The enrichment datastore is used to store the analyzed results, including any anomalies and additional metadata in tables. This setup provides full visibility into your data quality, helping you manage and improve it effectively.

!!! warning 
    Qualytics does not support the Presto connector as an enrichment datastore, but you can point to a different enrichment datastore. 

**Step 1:** Whether you have added a source datastore by creating a new datastore connection or using an existing connection, click on the **Next** button to start adding the **Enrichment Datastore**.
