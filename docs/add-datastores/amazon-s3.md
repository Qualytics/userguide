# Amazon S3

Adding and configuring an Amazon S3 connection within Qualytics empowers the platform to build a symbolic link with your file system to perform operations like data discovery, visualization, reporting, cataloging, profiling, scanning, anomaly surveillance, and more.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to add Amazon S3 as both a source and enrichment datastore in Qualytics. It covers the entire process, from initial connection setup to testing and finalizing the configuration.

By following these instructions, enterprises can ensure their Amazon S3 environment is properly connected with Qualytics, unlocking the platform's potential to help you proactively manage your full data quality lifecycle.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## Amazon S3 Setup Guide

This section provides a simple walkthrough for setting up Amazon S3, including retrieving URIs. It also explains how to retrieve the Access Key and Secret Key to configure datastore permissions.

By following the Amazon S3 setup process, you will ensure secure and efficient access to your stored data, allowing seamless datastore integration and proper access management in Qualytics.

### Retrieve the URI

The S3 URI is the unique resource identifier within the context of the S3 protocol. They follow this naming convention: `S3://bucket-name/key-name`

To retrieve the URL of an S3 object via the AWS Console, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **AWS S3 console** and click on your bucket's name (use the search input to find the object if necessary).
2. Click on the **checkbox** next to the object's name
3. Click on the **Copy S3 URI** button

![retrieve-the-uri](../assets/datastores/amazon-s3/retrieve-the-uri.png)

### Retrieve the Access Key and Secret Key

The access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use these keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).

To retrieve the Access Key and Secret Access Key, follow these steps:

1. Open the **IAM console**.
2. From the navigation menu, click on the **Users**.
3. Select your **IAM user name**.
4. Click on the **User Actions**, and then click on the **Manage Access Keys**.
5. Click on the **Create Access Key**.
6. Your keys will look something like this:
    7. Access key ID example: `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`.
    8. Secret access key example: `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`.
9. Click on the **Download Credentials**, and store the keys in a secure location.

!!! warning
    Your Secret Access Key will be visible only once at the time of creation. Please ensure you copy and securely store it for future use.

### Datastore Privileges

If you are using a private bucket, authentication is required for the connection.

#### Source Datastore Permissions (Read-Only)

To create a policy, follow these steps:

1. Open the **IAM console**.
2. Navigate to **Policies** in the IAM dashboard and select **Create Policy**.
3. Go to the **JSON** tab and paste the provided **JSON** into the **Policy editor**.

!!! tip
    Ensure you replace `<bucket/path>` with your specific resource.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:Get*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
!!! warning
    Currently, object-level permissions alone are insufficient to authenticate the connection. Please ensure you also include bucket-level permissions as demonstrated in the example above.

#### Enrichment Datastore Permissions (Read-Write)

To create a policy, follow these steps:

1. Open the IAM console.
2. Navigate to **Policies** in the IAM dashboard and select **Create Policy**.
3. Go to the **JSON tab** and paste the provided **JSON** into the **Policy editor**.

!!! tip
    Ensure you replace `<bucket/path>` with your specific resource.

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
!!! warning
    Currently, object-level permissions alone are insufficient to authenticate the connection. Please ensure you also include bucket-level permissions as demonstrated in the example above.

## Add a Source Datastore

A source datastore is a storage location used to connect and access data from external sources. Amazon S3 is an example of a source datastore, specifically a type of Distributed File System (DFS) datastore that is designed to handle data stored in distributed file systems. Configuring a DFS datastore enables the Qualytics platform to access and perform operations on the data, thereby generating valuable insights.

**Step 1**: Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the **Add Source Datastore** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.

![add-datastore](../assets/datastores/amazon-s3/add-datastore-light.png)

**Step 2**: A modal window - **Add Datastore** will appear, providing you with the options to connect a datastore.
