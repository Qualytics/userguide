# TimescaleDB
Adding and configuring a TimescaleDB connection within Qualytics empowers the platform to build a symbolic link with your schema to perform operations like data discovery, visualization, reporting, cataloging, profiling, scanning, anomaly surveillance, and more.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on adding TimescaleDB as a source datastore in Qualytics. It covers the entire process, from initial connection setup to testing and finalizing the configuration.

By following these instructions, enterprises can ensure their TimescaleDB environment is properly connected with Qualytics, unlocking the platform‚Äôs potential to help you proactively manage your full data quality lifecycle.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Add the Source Datastore

A source datastore is a storage location used to connect to and access data from external sources. TimescaleDB is an example of such a datastore, specifically a type of JDBC datastore that supports connectivity through the JDBC API. Configuring the TimescaleDB datastore allows the Qualytics platform to access and perform operations on the data, thereby generating valuable insights.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the **Add Source Datastore** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.

![add-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/add-datastore-light.png#only-light)
![add-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/add-datastore-dark.png#only-dark)

**Step 2:** A modal window- Add Datastore will appear, providing you with the options to connect a datastore.

![select-a-connector](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/select-a-connector-dark.png#only-dark)

| 1. | Name | Specify the name of the datastore (e.g., The specified name eill appear on the datastore cards) |
| --- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 2. | Toggle Button | Toggle ON to reuse credentials from an existing connection, or toggle OFF to create a new source datastore from scratch. |
| 3. | Connector | Select **TimescaleDB** from the dropdown list. |

### Option I: Create a Datastore with a new Connection

If the toggle for **Use an existing connection** is turned off, then this will prompt you to add and configure the source datastore from scratch without using existing connection details.

**Step 1 :** Select the **TimescaleDB** connector from the dropdown list and add connection details such as host, port, username, database, and schema.

![add-datastore-credentials-explain](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/add-datastore-credentials-explain-dark.png#only-dark)

| REF. | FIELDS | ACTIONS |
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
| 1. | Host | Get **Hostname** from your TimescaleDB account and add it to this field. |
| 2. | Port | Specify the **Port** number. |
| 3. | User | Enter the **User ID** to connect. |
| 4. | Password | Enter the **password** to connect to the database. |
| 5. |  Database | Specify the database name. |
| 6. | Schema | Define the schema within the database that should be used.
| 7. | Teams  | Select one or more teams from the dropdown to associate wit this source datastore. |
| 8. | Initial cataloging | Tick the checkbox to automatically perform catalog operation on the configured source to gather data structures and coressponding metadata. |                                                                                       

**Step 3 :** After adding the source datastore details, click on the **Test Connection** button to check and verify its connection.

![test-connection-for-existing-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/test-connection-for-existing-datastore-dark.png#only-dark)

!!! note
    Clicking on the **Finish** button will create the source datastore and bypass the **enrichment datastore** configuration step.

!!! tip
    It is recommended to click on the **Next**  button, which will take you to the **enrichment datastore** configuration page.

## Add Enrichment Datastore

After successfully testing and verifying your source datastore connection, you have the option to add an enrichment datastore (recommended). This datastore is used to store analyzed results, including. This setup provides comprehensive visibility into your data quality, enabling you to manage and improve it effectively.

!!! warning
    Qualytics does not support the TimescaleDB connector as an enrichment datastore, but you can point to a different enrichment datastore.

**Step 1:** Whether you have added a source datastore by creating a new datastore connection or using an existing connection, click on the **Next** button to start adding the **Enrichment Datastore**.

| 1. | Prefix | Add a prefix name to uniquely identify tables/files when Qualytics writes metadata from the metadata datastore to your enrichment datastore. |
| 2. | Toggle Button for existing enrichment datastore | Toggle ON to link the source datastore to an existing enrichment datastore,or toggle OFF to link it to a brand new enrichment datastore. |
| 3. | Name | Give a name for the enrichment datastore. |
| 4. | Toggle Button for using an existing connection | Toggle ON to reuse credentials from an existing connection, or toggle OFF to link it to a brand new enrichment datastore. |
| 5. | Connector | Select a datastore connector as **TimescaleDB** from the dropdown list. |

### Option I: Create an Enrichment Datastore with a new Connection

If the toggles for **Use an existing enrichment datastore** and **Use an existing connection** are turned off, then this will prompt you to add and configure the enrichment datastore from scratch without using an existing enrichment datastore and its connection details.

**Step 1:** Add connection details for your selected **enrichment datastore** connector.

![enrichment-datastore-explain](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/enrichment-datastore-explain-light.png#only-light)
![enrichment-datastore-explain](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/enrichment-datastore-explain-dark.png#only-dark)

!!! note
    Qualytics does not support TimescaleDB as an enrichment datastore. Instead, you can select a different enrichment datastore for this purpose. For demonstration purposes, we are using Microsoft SQL Server as the enrichment datastore. You can use any other JDBC or DFS datastore of your choice for the enrichment datastore configuration.

**Step 2:** Click on the **Test Connection** button to verify the selected enrichment datastore connection. If the connection is verified, a flash message will indicate that the connection with the datastore has been successfully verified.

![test-connection-for-enrichment-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/test-connection-light.png#only-light)
![test-connection-for-enrichment-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/test-connection-dark.png#only-dark)

### Option II: Use an Existing Connection

If the toggle for **Use an existing enrichment datastore** is turned on, you will be prompted to configure the enrichment datastore using existing connection details.

!!! note
    Qualytics does not support Timescale as an enrichment datastore. Instead, you can select a different enrichment datastore for this purpose. For demonstration purposes, we are using BigQuery as the enrichment datastore. You can use any other JDBC or DFS datastore of your choice for the enrichment datastore configuration.

**Step 1:** Add a prefix name and select an existing enrichment datastore from the dropdown list.

![select-existing-enrichment-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/select-enrichment-datastore-light.png#only-light)
![select-existing-enrichment-datastore](../assets/datastores/timescale-db/select-enrichment-datastore-dark.png#only-dark)

| REF. | FIELDS | ACTIONS |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| 1. | Prefix | Add a prefix name to uniquely identify tables/files when Qualytics writes metadata from the source datastore to your enrichment. |
| 2. | Toggle Button for existing enrichment datastore | Toogle ON to link the source datastore to an existing enrichment datastore. | 
| 3. | Enrichment Datastore | Select an enrichment datastore from the dropdown list. |

**Step 2:** After selecting an existing **enrichment datastore** connection, you will view the following details related to the selected enrichment:

-   **Teams:** The team associated with managing the enrichment datastore is based on the role of public or private. Example- Marked as **Public** means that this datastore is accessible to all the users.
-   **Host:** This is the server address where the **TimescaleDB** instance is hosted. It is the endpoint used to connect to the PostgreSQL environment.
-   **Database:** Refers to the specific database within the TimescaleDB environment where the data is stored.
-   **Schema:** The schema used in the enrichment datastore. The schema is a logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, etc.). Each schema belongs to a single database.
