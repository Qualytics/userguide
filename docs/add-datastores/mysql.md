# MySQL

Adding and configuring MySQL connection within Qualytics empowers the platform to build a symbolic link with your database to perform operations like data discovery, visualization, reporting, cataloging, profiling, scanning, anomaly surveillance, and more.

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to add MySQL as both a source and enrichment datastore in Qualytics. It covers the entire process, from initial connection setup to testing and finalizing the configuration.

By following these instructions, enterprises can ensure their MySQL environment is properly connected with Qualytics, unlocking the platform's potential to help you proactively manage your full data quality lifecycle.

Let‚Äôs get started üöÄ

## Add a Source Datastore

A source datastore is a storage location used to connect to and access data from external sources. MySQL is an example of a source datastore, specifically a type of JDBC datastore that supports connectivity through the JDBC API. Configuring the JDBC datastore enables the Qualytics platform to access and perform operations on the data, thereby generating valuable insights.

**Step 1**: Log in to your Qualytics account and click on the **Add Source Datastore** button located at the top-right corner of the interface.
